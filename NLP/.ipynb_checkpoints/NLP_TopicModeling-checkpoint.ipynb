If we simply search for a stop word in the entire string and remove it, we will lose some important information. Consider example of a word \"I.R.S\". If the logic is to remove stop words and punctuation from entire string in one go, then the dots within this word will get removed. On the other hand, if we tokenize first then the comparison will be with entire \"I.R.S\" word as a token and therefore the dots inside will not get removed. This is one simple example but I have seen better results when stop words removal is done after tokenization. If you need a single string, then simply concatenate all tokens in a list."

As of December\\xa02017, we had 36,600 total staff. \\nCompetition \\nThe financial services industry and all of our businesses are intensely competitive, and we expect them to remain so. Our competitors are other\\nentities that provide investment banking, securities and investment management services and retail lending and deposit-taking products, as well as those entities that make investments in securities, commodities, derivatives, real estate, loans and\\nother financial assets. These entities include brokers and dealers, investment banking firms, commercial banks, insurance companies, investment advisers, mutual funds, hedge funds, private equity funds, merchant banks, consumer finance companies and\\nfinancial technology and other internet-based companies. We compete with some entities globally and with others on a regional, product or niche basis. Our competition is based on a number of factors, including transaction execution, products and\\nservices, innovation, reputation and price.  There has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the financial\\nservices industry. Moreover, we have faced, and expect to continue to face, pressure to retain market share by committing capital to businesses or transactions on terms that offer returns that may not be commensurate with their risks. In particular,\\ncorporate clients seek such commitments (such as agreements to participate in their loan facilities) from financial services firms in connection with investment banking and other assignments. \\nConsolidation and convergence have significantly increased the capital base and geographic reach of some of our competitors, and have also\\nhastened the globalization of the securities and other financial services markets. As a result, we have had to commit capital to support our international operations and to execute large global transactions. To take advantage of some of our most\\nsignificant opportunities, we will have to compete successfully with financial institutions that are larger and have more capital and that may have a stronger local presence and longer operating history outside the U.S.\\n\\nWe also compete with smaller institutions that offer more targeted services, such as independent\\nadvisory firms. Some clients may perceive these firms to be less susceptible to potential conflicts of interest than we are, and, as described below, our ability to effectively compete with them could be affected by regulations and limitations on\\nactivities that apply to us but may not apply to them.  A number of our businesses are subject to intense price competition. Efforts by our\\ncompetitors to gain market share have resulted in pricing pressure in our investment banking and client execution businesses and could result in pricing pressure in other of our businesses. For example, the increasing volume of trades executed\\nelectronically, through the internet and through alternative trading systems, has increased the pressure on trading commissions, in that commissions for electronic trading are generally lower than for\\nnon-electronic trading. It appears that this trend toward low-commission trading will continue. Price competition has also led to compression in the difference between\\nthe price at which a market participant is willing to sell an instrument and the price at which another market participant is willing to buy it (i.e., bid/offer spread), which has affected our market-making businesses. In addition, we believe that\\nwe will continue to experience competitive pressures in these and other areas in the future as some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by further reducing prices, and as we enter into or expand our presence in markets that may rely more\\nheavily on electronic trading and execution.  We also compete on the basis of the types of financial products that we and our competitors\\noffer. In some circumstances, our competitors may offer financial products that we do not offer and our clients may prefer.  The provisions\\nof the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), the requirements promulgated by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) and other financial regulation could affect our competitive position\\nto the extent that limitations on activities, increased fees and compliance costs or other regulatory requirements do not apply, or do not apply equally, to all of our competitors or are not implemented uniformly across different jurisdictions. For\\nexample, the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that prohibit proprietary trading and restrict investments in certain hedge and private equity funds differentiate between U.S.-based and non-U.S.-based banking\\norganizations and give non-U.S.-based banking organizations greater flexibility to trade outside of the U.S. and to form and invest in funds outside the U.S.\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n6\\n\\xa0\\nGoldman\\xa0Sachs\\xa02017\\xa0Form 10-K\\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Our competition is based on a number of factors, including transaction execution, products and\\nservices, innovation, reputation and price.  There has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the financial\\nservices industry. Moreover, we have faced, and expect to continue to face, pressure to retain market share by committing capital to businesses or transactions on terms that offer returns that may not be commensurate with their risks. In particular,\\ncorporate clients seek such commitments (such as agreements to participate in their loan facilities) from financial services firms in connection with investment banking and other assignments. \\nConsolidation and convergence have significantly increased the capital base and geographic reach of some of our competitors, and have also\\nhastened the globalization of the securities and other financial services markets. As a result, we have had to commit capital to support our international operations and to execute large global transactions. To take advantage of some of our most\\nsignificant opportunities, we will have to compete successfully with financial institutions that are larger and have more capital and that may have a stronger local presence and longer operating history outside the U.S.\\nInstilling the Goldman Sachs culture in all employees is a continuous process, in which training\\nplays an important part. All employees are offered the opportunity to participate in education and periodic seminars that we sponsor at various locations throughout the world. Another important part of instilling the Goldman Sachs culture is our\\nemployee review process. Employees are reviewed by supervisors, co-workers and employees they supervise in a 360-degree review process that is integral to our team\\napproach, and includes an evaluation of an employee\\x92s performance with respect to risk management, compliance and diversity. As of December\\xa02017, we had 36,600 total staff. Competition The financial services industry and all of our businesses are intensely competitive, and we expect them to remain so. Our competitors are other\\nentities that provide investment banking, securities and investment management services and retail lending and deposit-taking products, as well as those entities that make investments in securities, commodities, derivatives, real estate, loans and\\nother financial assets. These entities include brokers and dealers, investment banking firms, commercial banks, insurance companies, investment advisers, mutual funds, hedge funds, private equity funds, merchant banks, consumer finance companies and\\nfinancial technology and other internet-based companies.

To take advantage of some of our most\\nsignificant opportunities, we will have to compete successfully with financial institutions that are larger and have more capital and that may have a stronger local presence and longer operating history outside the U.S.\\n\\nWe also compete with smaller institutions that offer more targeted services, such as independent\\nadvisory firms. Some clients may perceive these firms to be less susceptible to potential conflicts of interest than we are, and, as described below, our ability to effectively compete with them could be affected by regulations and limitations on\\nactivities that apply to us but may not apply to them.  A number of our businesses are subject to intense price competition. Efforts by our\\ncompetitors to gain market share have resulted in pricing pressure in our investment banking and client execution businesses and could result in pricing pressure in other of our businesses. For example, the increasing volume of trades executed\\nelectronically, through the internet and through alternative trading systems, has increased the pressure on trading commissions, in that commissions for electronic trading are generally lower than for\\nnon-electronic trading. It appears that this trend toward low-commission trading will continue. Price competition has also led to compression in the difference between\\nthe price at which a market participant is willing to sell an instrument and the price at which another market participant is willing to buy it (i.e., bid/offer spread), which has affected our market-making businesses. In addition, we believe that\\nwe will continue to experience competitive pressures in these and other areas in the future as some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by further reducing prices, and as we enter into or expand our presence in markets that may rely more\\nheavily on electronic trading and execution.  We also compete on the basis of the types of financial products that we and our competitors\\noffer. In some circumstances, our competitors may offer financial products that we do not offer and our clients may prefer.  The provisions\\nof the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), the requirements promulgated by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) and other financial regulation could affect our competitive position\\nto the extent that limitations on activities, increased fees and compliance costs or other regulatory requirements do not apply, or do not apply equally, to all of our competitors or are not implemented uniformly across different jurisdictions. For\\nexample, the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that prohibit proprietary trading and restrict investments in certain hedge and private equity funds differentiate between U.S.-based and non-U.S.-based banking\\norganizations and give non-U.S.-based banking organizations greater flexibility to trade outside of the U.S. and to form and invest in funds outside the U.S.\\nWe also compete with smaller institutions that offer more targeted services, such as independent\\nadvisory firms.

The Capital Framework provides for an additional capital ratio requirement that\\nphases in over time and consists of three components: (i)\\xa0for capital conservation (capital conservation buffer), (ii)\\xa0as a consequence of our designation as a G-SIB\\n(G-SIB buffer) and (iii)\\xa0for countercyclicality (countercyclical capital buffer). The additional capital ratio requirement must be satisfied entirely with capital that qualifies as Common Equity\\nTier\\xa01 (CET1). GSI, our regulated U.K. broker-dealer subsidiary, which is a designated investment firm, and\\nGSIB, our regulated U.K. bank and principal non-U.S. bank subsidiary, are regulated by the PRA and the FCA. GSI provides broker-dealer services in and from the U.K., and GSIB acts as a primary dealer for\\nEuropean government bonds and is involved in market making in European government bonds, lending (including securities lending) and deposit-taking activities. Capital, Leverage and Liquidity Requirements. The firm\\nand GS Bank USA are subject to consolidated regulatory capital and leverage requirements set forth by the FRB. GSI and GSIB are subject to capital requirements prescribed in the E.U. Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) and the E.U. Fourth Capital\\nRequirements Directive (CRD\\xa0IV). Under the FRB\\x92s capital adequacy requirements, the firm and GS Bank USA must meet\\nspecific regulatory capital requirements that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items. The sufficiency of our capital levels is also subject to qualitative\\njudgments by regulators. The firm and GS Bank USA are also subject to liquidity requirements established by the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies, and GSI and GSIB are subject to similar requirements established by U.K. regulatory authorities.\\nCapital Ratios. We are subject to the FRB\\x92s risk-based capital and leverage regulations, subject to certain transitional provisions (Capital Framework).

We publish summaries of our annual and mid-cycle stress tests results on our website as described in\\n\\x93Available Information\\x94 below. Our annual stress test submission is incorporated into the annual capital plans that we submit to\\nthe FRB as part of the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) of large BHCs, which is designed to ensure that capital planning processes will permit continued operations by such institutions during times of economic and financial stress.\\nAs part of CCAR, the FRB evaluates an institution\\x92s plan to make capital distributions, such as repurchasing or redeeming stock or increasing dividend payments, across a range of macroeconomic and firm-specific assumptions based on the\\ninstitution\\x92s and the FRB\\x92s stress tests. If the FRB objects to an institution\\x92s capital plan, the institution is generally prohibited from making capital distributions other than distributions to which the FRB has not objected. In\\naddition, an institution faces limitations on capital distributions to the extent that actual capital issuances are less than the amounts indicated in its capital plan.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \\n\\xa0\\n\\nGS Bank USA is also required to conduct stress tests on an annual basis, to submit the results\\nto the FRB, and to publicly disclose a summary of those results. GSI and GSIB also have their own capital planning and stress testing process, which incorporates internally designed stress tests and those required under the PRA\\x92s Internal\\nCapital Adequacy Assessment Process.  Dividends and Stock Repurchases. Dividend payments by Group Inc. to its shareholders and stock repurchases by Group Inc. are subject to the oversight of the FRB. \\nU.S. federal and state laws impose limitations on the payment of dividends by U.S. depository institutions, such as GS Bank USA. In general,\\nthe amount of dividends that may be paid by GS Bank USA is limited to the lesser of the amounts calculated under a \\x93recent earnings\\x94 test and an \\x93undivided profits\\x94 test. Under the recent earnings test, a dividend may not be paid\\nif the total of all dividends declared by the entity in any calendar year is in excess of the current year\\x92s net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years, unless the entity obtains prior regulatory approval. Under\\nthe undivided profits test, a dividend may not be paid in excess of the entity\\x92s \\x93undivided profits\\x94 (generally, accumulated net profits that have not been paid out as dividends or transferred to surplus). \\nThe applicable U.S. banking regulators have authority to prohibit or limit the payment of dividends if, in the banking regulator\\x92s\\nopinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization. The BHC Act prohibits the FRB from requiring a payment by a BHC subsidiary to a depository institution if\\nthe functional regulator of that subsidiary objects to such payment. In such a case, the FRB could instead require the divestiture of the depository institution and impose operating restrictions pending the divestiture. \\nSource of Strength. The Dodd-Frank Act requires BHCs to\\nact as a source of strength to their bank subsidiaries and to commit capital and financial resources to support those subsidiaries. This support may be required by the FRB at times when we might otherwise determine not to provide it. Capital loans\\nby a BHC to a subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank. In addition, if a BHC commits to a U.S. federal banking agency that it will maintain the capital of its bank\\nsubsidiary, whether in response to the FRB\\x92s invoking its source-of-strength authority or in response to other regulatory measures, that commitment will be assumed\\nby the bankruptcy trustee for the BHC and the bank will be entitled to priority payment in respect of that commitment, ahead of other creditors of the BHC.\\n\\nTransactions between Affiliates. Transactions between GS Bank USA or its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Group Inc. or its other subsidiaries and affiliates, on the other hand, are regulated by the FRB. These regulations generally limit the\\ntypes and amounts of transactions (including credit extensions from GS Bank USA or its subsidiaries to Group Inc. or its other subsidiaries and affiliates) that may take place and generally require those transactions to be on market terms or better\\nto GS Bank USA or its subsidiaries. These regulations generally do not apply to transactions between GS Bank USA and its subsidiaries. The Dodd-Frank Act expanded the coverage and scope of these regulations, including by applying them to the credit\\nexposure arising under derivative transactions, repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, and securities borrowing and lending transactions. \\nResolution and Recovery. Group Inc. is required by the\\nFRB and the FDIC to submit a periodic plan for its rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure (resolution plan). Our resolution plan must, among other things, demonstrate that GS Bank USA is adequately\\nprotected from risks arising from our other entities. If the regulators jointly determine that an institution has failed to remediate identified shortcomings in its resolution plan and that its resolution plan, after any permitted resubmission, is\\nnot credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the regulators may jointly impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on growth, activities or operations or may\\njointly order the institutions to divest assets or operations in order to facilitate orderly resolution in the event of failure. See \\x93Risk Factors\\xa0\\x97 The application of Group Inc.\\x92s proposed resolution strategy could result in\\ngreater losses for Group Inc.\\x92s security holders, and failure to address shortcomings in our resolution plan could subject us to increased regulatory requirements\\x94 in Part\\xa0I, Item\\xa01A of this\\nForm\\xa010-K and \\x93Management\\x92s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\\xa0\\x97 Regulatory Matters and Developments\\xa0\\x97 Resolution and Recovery\\nPlans\\x94 in Part\\xa0II, Item\\xa07 of this Form\\xa010-K for further information about our resolution plan.\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGoldman\\xa0Sachs\\xa02017\\xa0Form 10-K\\n\\xa0\\n11\\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The rule will begin to phase in on January\\xa01,\\xa02019 and will be fully effective on January\\xa01,\\xa02020.

The ISDA Protocol imposes a stay on certain cross-default and early termination rights within standard ISDA derivative contracts and securities financing transactions between adhering parties in the event that one of them is\\nsubject to resolution in its home jurisdiction, including a resolution under the OLA or the FDIA in the U.S. The ISDA Protocol is expected to be adopted more broadly in the future, following the phase-in of\\nQFC regulations adopted by banking regulators (including the FRB\\x92s final rule on QFCs) that impose additional requirements in order for G-SIBs, such as us, to enter into QFCs with counterparties that do\\nnot adhere to the ISDA Protocol. \\nThe E.U. Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) establishes a framework for the recovery\\nand resolution of financial institutions in the E.U., such as GSI and GSIB. The BRRD provides national supervisory authorities with tools and powers to pre-emptively address potential financial crises in order\\nto promote financial stability and minimize taxpayers\\x92 exposure to losses. The BRRD requires E.U. member states to grant \\x93bail-in\\x94 powers to E.U. resolution authorities to recapitalize a failing\\nentity by writing down its unsecured debt or converting its unsecured debt into equity. Financial institutions in the E.U. must provide that new contracts enable such actions and also amend pre-existing\\ncontracts governed by non-E.U. law to enable such actions, if the financial institutions could incur liabilities under such pre-existing contracts. \\nThe BRRD also subjects financial institutions to a minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) so that they can be\\nresolved without causing financial instability and without recourse to public funds in the event of a failure.

G-SIB\\nthat account for more than 5% of its RWAs, operating income or leverage exposure, such as GSI, to meet 90% of the requirement applicable to E.U. G-SIBs. \\nIn November\\xa02016, the European Commission also proposed an amendment to CRD\\xa0IV that would require a\\nnon-E.U.

As a result, whether or not the FDIC ever sought to repudiate any debt obligations of GS Bank USA, the debtholders (other than depositors) would be treated differently from, and could receive,\\nif anything, substantially less than, the depositors of GS Bank USA.  The Dodd-Frank Act created a new resolution regime (known as OLA) for\\nBHCs and their affiliates that are systemically important and certain non-bank financial companies. Under OLA, the FDIC may be appointed as receiver for the systemically important institution and its failed non-bank subsidiaries if, upon the recommendation of applicable regulators, the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury determines, among other things, that the institution is in default or in danger of default, that the\\ninstitution\\x92s failure would have serious adverse effects on the U.S. financial system and that resolution under OLA would avoid or mitigate those effects.\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGoldman\\xa0Sachs\\xa02017\\xa0Form 10-K\\n\\xa0\\n13\\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES \\n\\xa0\\n\\nIn addition, the Volcker Rule limits the sponsorship of, and investment in, \\x93covered\\nfunds\\x94 (as defined in the rule) by banking entities, including us. It also limits certain types of transactions between us and our sponsored funds, similar to the limitations on transactions between depository institutions and their affiliates.\\nCovered funds include our private equity funds, certain of our credit and real estate funds, our hedge funds and certain other investment structures. The limitation on investments in covered funds requires us to reduce our investment in each such\\nfund to 3% or less of the fund\\x92s net asset value, and to reduce our aggregate investment in all such funds to 3% or less of our Tier\\xa01 capital. \\nThe FRB has extended the conformance period to July\\xa02022 for our investments in, and relationships with, certain legacy \\x93illiquid\\nfunds\\x94 (as defined in the Volcker Rule) that were in place prior to December\\xa02013. See Note\\xa06 to the consolidated financial statements in Part\\xa0II, Item 8 of this Form\\xa010-K for further\\ninformation about our investments in such funds.  Other Restrictions. FHCs generally can engage in a broader range of financial and related activities than are otherwise permissible for BHCs as long as they continue to meet the eligibility requirements for FHCs. The broader range\\nof permissible activities for FHCs includes underwriting, dealing and making markets in securities and making investments in non-FHCs (merchant banking activities). In addition, certain FHCs are permitted\\nunder the GLB Act to engage in certain commodities activities in the U.S. that may otherwise be impermissible for BHCs, so long as the assets held pursuant to these activities do not equal 5% or more of their consolidated assets. \\nThe FRB, however, has the authority to limit an FHC\\x92s ability to conduct activities that would otherwise be permissible, and will likely\\ndo so if the FHC does not satisfactorily meet certain requirements of the FRB. For example, if an FHC or any of its U.S. depository institution subsidiaries ceases to maintain its status as well-capitalized or well-managed, the FRB may impose\\ncorrective capital and/or managerial requirements, as well as additional limitations or conditions. If the deficiencies persist, the FHC may be required to divest its U.S. depository institution subsidiaries or to cease engaging in activities other\\nthan the business of banking and certain closely related activities.\\n\\nIf any insured depository institution subsidiary of an FHC fails to maintain at least a\\n\\x93satisfactory\\x94 rating under the Community Reinvestment Act, the FHC would be subject to restrictions on certain new activities and acquisitions. \\nIn addition, we are required to obtain prior FRB approval before engaging in certain banking and other financial activities both within and\\noutside the U.S.  In September\\xa02016, the FRB issued a proposed rule which, if adopted, would impose new requirements on the physical\\ncommodity activities and certain merchant banking activities of FHCs. The proposed rule would, among other things, (i)\\xa0require FHCs to hold additional capital in connection with covered physical commodity activities, including merchant banking\\ninvestments in companies engaged in physical commodity activities; (ii)\\xa0tighten the quantitative limits on permissible physical trading activity; and (iii)\\xa0establish new public reporting requirements on the nature and extent of FHC\\x92s\\nphysical commodity holdings and activities. In addition, in a September\\xa02016 report, the FRB recommended that Congress repeal (i)\\xa0the authority of FHCs to engage in merchant banking activities; and (ii)\\xa0the authority described above\\nfor certain FHCs to engage in certain otherwise permissible commodities activities.  In March\\xa02016, the FRB issued a revised proposal\\nregarding single counterparty credit limits, which would impose more stringent requirements for credit exposures among major financial institutions.

Securitizations would also be affected by rules proposed by the SEC to implement the Dodd-Frank Act\\x92s prohibition against\\nsecuritization participants engaging in any transaction that would involve or result in any material conflict of interest with an investor in a securitization transaction. The proposed rules would exempt bona fide market-making activities and\\nrisk-mitigating hedging activities in connection with securitization activities from the general prohibition.

CFTC rules require\\nregistration of swap dealers, mandatory clearing and execution of interest rate and credit default swaps and real-time public reporting and adherence to business conduct standards for all in-scope swaps. In December\\xa02016, the CFTC proposed\\nrevised capital regulations for swap dealers that are not subject to the capital rules of a prudential regulator, such as the FRB, as well as a liquidity requirement for those swap dealers.\\n\\nSEC rules govern the registration and regulation of security-based swap dealers but compliance\\nwith such rules is not currently required. The SEC has proposed rules that would govern the design of new trading venues for security-based swaps and establish the process for determining which products must be traded on these venues. \\nGS&Co. is registered with the CFTC as a futures commission merchant, and several of our subsidiaries, including GS&Co., are registered\\nwith the CFTC and act as commodity pool operators and commodity trading advisors.

In addition,\\nGoldman Sachs Financial Markets, L.P. is registered with the SEC as an OTC derivatives dealer.  Our affiliates registered as swap dealers\\nare subject to the margin rules issued by the CFTC (in the case of our non-bank swap dealers) and the FRB (in the case of GS Bank USA). The rules for variation margin have become effective, and those for\\ninitial margin will phase in through September\\xa02020 depending on certain activity levels of the swap dealer and the relevant counterparty. In contrast to the FRB margin rules, inter-affiliate transactions under the CFTC margin rules are\\ngenerally exempt from initial margin requirements.  The CFTC has proposed position limit rules that will limit the size of positions that\\ncan be held by any entity, or any group of affiliates or other parties trading under common control, subject to certain exemptions, such as for bona fide hedging positions. These proposed rules would apply to positions in swaps as well as futures\\nand options on futures.  Similar types of swap regulation have been proposed or adopted in jurisdictions outside the U.S., including in the\\nE.U. and Japan. For example, the E.U. has established regulatory requirements relating to portfolio reconciliation and reporting, clearing certain OTC derivatives and margining for uncleared derivatives activities under the European Market\\nInfrastructure Regulation. \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGoldman\\xa0Sachs\\xa02017\\xa0Form 10-K\\n\\xa0\\n17\\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The CFTC has proposed position limit rules that will limit the size of positions that\\ncan be held by any entity, or any group of affiliates or other parties trading under common control, subject to certain exemptions, such as for bona fide hedging positions. These proposed rules would apply to positions in swaps as well as futures\\nand options on futures.  Similar types of swap regulation have been proposed or adopted in jurisdictions outside the U.S., including in the\\nE.U. and Japan. For example, the E.U. has established regulatory requirements relating to portfolio reconciliation and reporting, clearing certain OTC derivatives and margining for uncleared derivatives activities under the European Market\\nInfrastructure Regulation. SEC rules govern the registration and regulation of security-based swap dealers but compliance\\nwith such rules is not currently required.

The guidance provides that supervisory findings with respect to incentive compensation will be\\nincorporated, as appropriate, into the organization\\x92s supervisory ratings, which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions.

In equities, MiFID II introduced volume caps on non-transparent liquidity trading for trading venues, limited the use of broker-dealer crossing\\nnetworks and created a new regime for systematic internalizers, which are investment firms that execute client transactions outside a trading venue. \\nAdditional controls were introduced for algorithmic trading, high frequency trading and direct electronic access. Commodities trading firms are\\nrequired to calculate their positions and adhere to specific limits. Other reforms introduced enhanced transaction reporting, the publication of best execution data by investment firms and trading venues, transparency on costs and charges of service\\nto investors, changes to the way investment managers can pay for the receipt of investment research and mandatory unbundling for broker-dealers between execution and other major services. \\nOn October\\xa026,\\xa02017, the SEC staff issued guidance permitting U.S. broker-dealers to comply with MiFID II without being subject to\\nconflicting U.S. regulation or other adverse U.S. regulatory effects.

The following are some of the more important factors that could affect our businesses.  Our businesses have\\nbeen and may continue to be adversely affected by conditions in the global financial markets and economic conditions generally. \\nOur businesses, by their nature, do not produce predictable earnings, and all of our businesses are materially affected by conditions in the\\nglobal financial markets and economic conditions generally, both directly and through their impact on client activity levels. These conditions can change suddenly and negatively. \\nOur financial performance is highly dependent on the environment in which our businesses operate. A favorable business environment is generally\\ncharacterized by, among other factors, high global gross domestic product growth, regulatory and market conditions which result in transparent, liquid and efficient capital markets, low inflation, high business and investor confidence, stable\\ngeopolitical conditions, clear regulations and strong business earnings.\\n\\nUnfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by: concerns about\\nsovereign defaults; uncertainty concerning fiscal or monetary policy, government debt ceilings or funding; the extent of and uncertainty about tax and other regulatory changes; declines in economic growth, business activity or investor or business\\nconfidence; limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital; illiquid markets; increases in inflation, interest rates, exchange rate or basic commodity price volatility or default rates; outbreaks of domestic or\\ninternational tensions or hostilities, terrorism, nuclear proliferation, cybersecurity threats or attacks and other forms of disruption to or curtailment of global communication, energy transmission or transportation networks or other geopolitical\\ninstability or uncertainty, such as Brexit; corporate, political or other scandals that reduce investor confidence in capital markets; extreme weather events or other natural disasters or pandemics; or a combination of these or other factors. \\nThe financial services industry and the securities markets have been materially and adversely affected in the past by significant declines in\\nthe values of nearly all asset classes and by a serious lack of liquidity. In addition, concerns about European sovereign debt risk and its impact on the European banking system, about the impact of Brexit, and about changes in interest rates and\\nother market conditions or actual changes in interest rates and other market conditions, including market conditions in China, have resulted, at times, in significant volatility while negatively impacting the levels of client activity. \\nGeneral uncertainty about economic, political and market activities, and the scope, timing and impact of regulatory reform, as well as weak\\nconsumer, investor and CEO confidence resulting in large part from such uncertainty, continues to negatively impact client activity, which adversely affects many of our businesses. Periods of low volatility and periods of high volatility combined\\nwith a lack of liquidity, have at times had an unfavorable impact on our market-making businesses.  Our revenues and profitability and\\nthose of our competitors have been and will continue to be impacted by requirements relating to capital, additional loss-absorbing capacity, leverage, minimum liquidity and long-term funding levels, requirements related to resolution and recovery\\nplanning, derivatives clearing and margin rules and levels of regulatory oversight, as well as limitations on which and, if permitted, how certain business activities may be carried out by financial institutions.\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGoldman\\xa0Sachs\\xa02017\\xa0Form 10-K\\n\\xa0\\n23\\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The ultimate methods of calculating the ratios will depend on, among other things, implementation guidance or further\\nrulemaking from the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies and the development of market practices and standards. Item\\xa01A.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Risk Factors We face a variety of risks that are substantial and inherent in our businesses, including market, liquidity, credit, operational, legal,\\nregulatory and reputational risks. The following are some of the more important factors that could affect our businesses. Our businesses have\\nbeen and may continue to be adversely affected by conditions in the global financial markets and economic conditions generally. Our businesses, by their nature, do not produce predictable earnings, and all of our businesses are materially affected by conditions in the\\nglobal financial markets and economic conditions generally, both directly and through their impact on client activity levels. These conditions can change suddenly and negatively. Our financial performance is highly dependent on the environment in which our businesses operate. A favorable business environment is generally\\ncharacterized by, among other factors, high global gross domestic product growth, regulatory and market conditions which result in transparent, liquid and efficient capital markets, low inflation, high business and investor confidence, stable\\ngeopolitical conditions, clear regulations and strong business earnings.\\n\\nUnfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by: concerns about\\nsovereign defaults; uncertainty concerning fiscal or monetary policy, government debt ceilings or funding; the extent of and uncertainty about tax and other regulatory changes; declines in economic growth, business activity or investor or business\\nconfidence; limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital; illiquid markets; increases in inflation, interest rates, exchange rate or basic commodity price volatility or default rates; outbreaks of domestic or\\ninternational tensions or hostilities, terrorism, nuclear proliferation, cybersecurity threats or attacks and other forms of disruption to or curtailment of global communication, energy transmission or transportation networks or other geopolitical\\ninstability or uncertainty, such as Brexit; corporate, political or other scandals that reduce investor confidence in capital markets; extreme weather events or other natural disasters or pandemics; or a combination of these or other factors. \\nThe financial services industry and the securities markets have been materially and adversely affected in the past by significant declines in\\nthe values of nearly all asset classes and by a serious lack of liquidity. In addition, concerns about European sovereign debt risk and its impact on the European banking system, about the impact of Brexit, and about changes in interest rates and\\nother market conditions or actual changes in interest rates and other market conditions, including market conditions in China, have resulted, at times, in significant volatility while negatively impacting the levels of client activity. \\nGeneral uncertainty about economic, political and market activities, and the scope, timing and impact of regulatory reform, as well as weak\\nconsumer, investor and CEO confidence resulting in large part from such uncertainty, continues to negatively impact client activity, which adversely affects many of our businesses. Periods of low volatility and periods of high volatility combined\\nwith a lack of liquidity, have at times had an unfavorable impact on our market-making businesses.  Our revenues and profitability and\\nthose of our competitors have been and will continue to be impacted by requirements relating to capital, additional loss-absorbing capacity, leverage, minimum liquidity and long-term funding levels, requirements related to resolution and recovery\\nplanning, derivatives clearing and margin rules and levels of regulatory oversight, as well as limitations on which and, if permitted, how certain business activities may be carried out by financial institutions.\\nUnfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by: concerns about\\nsovereign defaults; uncertainty concerning fiscal or monetary policy, government debt ceilings or funding; the extent of and uncertainty about tax and other regulatory changes; declines in economic growth, business activity or investor or business\\nconfidence; limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital; illiquid markets; increases in inflation, interest rates, exchange rate or basic commodity price volatility or default rates; outbreaks of domestic or\\ninternational tensions or hostilities, terrorism, nuclear proliferation, cybersecurity threats or attacks and other forms of disruption to or curtailment of global communication, energy transmission or transportation networks or other geopolitical\\ninstability or uncertainty, such as Brexit; corporate, political or other scandals that reduce investor confidence in capital markets; extreme weather events or other natural disasters or pandemics; or a combination of these or other factors.

AND SUBSIDIARIES \\n\\xa0\\n\\nAlthough interest rates are still near historically low levels, financial institution returns in\\nmany countries have also been negatively impacted by increased funding costs due in part to the withdrawal of perceived government support of such institutions in the event of future financial crises. In addition, liquidity in the financial markets\\nhas also been negatively impacted as market participants and market practices and structures continue to adjust to new regulations.  The\\ndegree to which these and other changes resulting from the financial crisis will have a long-term impact on the profitability of financial institutions will depend on the implementation of recently adopted and new regulations, the manner in which\\nmarkets, market participants and financial institutions adapt to these regulations, and the prevailing economic and financial market conditions. However, there is a significant risk that such changes will, at least in the near term, continue to\\nnegatively impact the absolute level of revenues, profitability and return on equity at our firm and at other financial institutions.  Our\\nbusinesses and those of our clients are subject to extensive and pervasive regulation around the world.  As a participant in the\\nfinancial services industry and a systemically important financial institution, we are subject to extensive regulation in jurisdictions around the world. We face the risk of significant intervention by law enforcement, regulatory and taxing\\nauthorities, as well as private litigation, in all jurisdictions in which we conduct our businesses. In many cases, our activities may be subject to overlapping and divergent regulation in different jurisdictions. Among other things, as a result of\\nlaw enforcement authorities, regulators or private parties challenging our compliance with existing laws and regulations, we or our employees could be fined or criminally sanctioned, prohibited from engaging in some of our business activities,\\nsubject to limitations or conditions on our business activities, including higher capital requirements, or subjected to new or substantially higher taxes or other governmental charges in connection with the conduct of our businesses or with respect\\nto our employees. Such limitations or conditions may limit our business activities and negatively impact our profitability.  In addition to\\nthe impact on the scope and profitability of our business activities, day-to-day compliance with existing laws and regulations, in particular those adopted since 2008,\\nhas involved and will, except to the extent that some of such regulations are eventually modified or otherwise repealed, continue to involve significant amounts of time, including that of our senior leaders and that of a large number of dedicated\\ncompliance and other reporting and operational personnel, all of which may negatively impact our profitability.\\n\\nIf there are new laws or regulations or changes in the enforcement of existing laws or\\nregulations applicable to our businesses or those of our clients, including capital, liquidity, leverage, long-term debt, total loss-absorbing capacity and margin requirements, restrictions on leveraged lending or other business practices, reporting\\nrequirements, requirements relating to recovery and resolution planning, tax burdens and compensation restrictions, that are imposed on a limited subset of financial institutions (either based on size, activities, geography or other criteria),\\ncompliance with these new laws or regulations, or changes in the enforcement of existing laws or regulations, could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively with other institutions that are not affected in the same way. In addition,\\nregulation imposed on financial institutions or market participants generally, such as taxes on financial transactions, could adversely impact levels of market activity more broadly, and thus impact our businesses. \\nThese developments could impact our profitability in the affected jurisdictions, or even make it uneconomic for us to continue to conduct all\\nor certain of our businesses in such jurisdictions, or could cause us to incur significant costs associated with changing our business practices, restructuring our businesses, moving all or certain of our businesses and our employees to other\\nlocations or complying with applicable capital requirements, including liquidating assets or raising capital in a manner that adversely increases our funding costs or otherwise adversely affects our shareholders and creditors. \\nU.S. and non-U.S. regulatory developments, in particular the Dodd-Frank Act and Basel\\xa0III, have\\nsignificantly altered the regulatory framework within which we operate and have adversely affected and may in the future affect our profitability. \\nAmong the aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act that have affected or may in the future affect our businesses are: increased capital, liquidity and\\nreporting requirements; limitations on activities in which we may engage; increased regulation of and restrictions on OTC derivatives markets and transactions; limitations on incentive compensation; limitations on affiliate transactions;\\nrequirements to reorganize or limit activities in connection with recovery and resolution planning; increased deposit insurance assessments; and increased standards of care for broker-dealers and investment advisers in dealing with clients. The\\nimplementation of higher capital requirements, the LCR, the NSFR, requirements relating to long-term debt and total loss-absorbing capacity and the prohibition on proprietary trading and the sponsorship of, or investment in, covered funds by the\\nVolcker Rule may continue to adversely affect our profitability and competitive position, particularly if these requirements do not apply equally to our competitors or are not implemented uniformly across jurisdictions.\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n24\\n\\xa0\\nGoldman\\xa0Sachs\\xa02017\\xa0Form 10-K\\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Sudden declines and significant volatility in the prices of assets may substantially curtail or eliminate the trading markets for certain assets, which may make it\\ndifficult to sell, hedge or value such assets. The inability to sell or effectively hedge assets reduces our ability to limit losses in such positions and the difficulty in valuing assets may negatively affect our capital, liquidity or leverage\\nratios, increase our funding costs and generally require us to maintain additional capital.  In our exchange-based market-making\\nactivities, we are obligated by stock exchange rules to maintain an orderly market, including by purchasing securities in a declining market. In markets where asset values are declining and in volatile markets, this results in losses and an\\nincreased need for liquidity.  We receive asset-based management fees based on the value of our clients\\x92 portfolios or investment in\\nfunds managed by us and, in some cases, we also receive incentive fees based on increases in the value of such investments. Declines in asset values reduce the value of our clients\\x92 portfolios or fund assets, which in turn reduce the fees we\\nearn for managing such assets.  We post collateral to support our obligations and receive collateral to support the obligations of our\\nclients and counterparties in connection with our client execution businesses. When the value of the assets posted as collateral or the credit ratings of the party posting collateral decline, the party posting the collateral may need to provide\\nadditional collateral or, if possible, reduce its trading position. An example of such a situation is a \\x93margin call\\x94 in connection with a brokerage account.

In addition, volatile or less liquid markets increase the difficulty of\\nvaluing assets, which can lead to costly and time-consuming disputes over asset values and the level of required collateral, as well as increased credit risk to the recipient of the collateral due to delays in receiving adequate collateral. In cases\\nwhere we foreclose on collateral, sudden declines in the value or liquidity of such collateral may, despite credit monitoring, over-collateralization, the ability to call for additional collateral or the ability to force repayment of the underlying\\nobligation, result in significant losses to us, especially where there is a single type of collateral supporting the obligation. In addition, we have been, and may in the future be, subject to claims that the foreclosure was not permitted under the\\nlegal documents, was conducted in an improper manner or caused a client or counterparty to go out of business.  Our businesses have been and\\nmay be adversely affected by disruptions in the credit markets, including reduced access to credit and higher costs of obtaining credit. \\nWidening credit spreads, as well as significant declines in the availability of credit, have in the past adversely affected our ability to\\nborrow on a secured and unsecured basis and may do so in the future. We fund ourselves on an unsecured basis by issuing long-term debt, by accepting deposits at our bank subsidiaries, by issuing hybrid financial instruments or by obtaining loans or\\nlines of credit from commercial or other banking entities. We seek to finance many of our assets on a secured basis. Any disruptions in the credit markets may make it harder and more expensive to obtain funding for our businesses.

In addition, to the extent permitted by applicable law and regulation, we invest our own capital in private equity, credit, real estate and hedge funds that we manage and limitations on our\\nability to withdraw some or all of our investments in these funds, whether for legal, reputational or other reasons, may make it more difficult for us to control the risk exposures relating to these investments. \\nPrudent risk management, as well as regulatory restrictions, may cause us to limit our exposure to counterparties, geographic areas or markets,\\nwhich may limit our business opportunities and increase the cost of our funding or hedging activities.

AND SUBSIDIARIES \\n\\xa0\\n\\nNotwithstanding the proliferation of technology and technology-based risk and control systems,\\nour businesses ultimately rely on people as our greatest resource, and, from time-to-time, they make mistakes that are not always caught immediately by our technological\\nprocesses or by our other procedures which are intended to prevent and detect such errors. These can include calculation errors, mistakes in addressing emails, errors in software or model development or implementation, or simple errors in judgment.\\nWe strive to eliminate such human errors through training, supervision, technology and by redundant processes and controls. Human errors, even if promptly discovered and remediated, can result in material losses and liabilities for us. \\nIn addition, we face the risk of operational failure, termination or capacity constraints of any of the clearing agents, exchanges, clearing\\nhouses or other financial intermediaries we use to facilitate our securities and derivatives transactions, and as our interconnectivity with our clients grows, we increasingly face the risk of operational failure with respect to our clients\\x92\\nsystems.  In recent years, there has been significant consolidation among clearing agents, exchanges and clearing houses and an increasing\\nnumber of derivative transactions are now or in the near future will be cleared on exchanges, which has increased our exposure to operational failure, termination or capacity constraints of the particular financial intermediaries that we use and\\ncould affect our ability to find adequate and cost-effective alternatives in the event of any such failure, termination or constraint. Industry consolidation, whether among market participants or financial intermediaries, increases the risk of\\noperational failure as disparate complex systems need to be integrated, often on an accelerated basis.  Furthermore, the interconnectivity\\nof multiple financial institutions with central agents, exchanges and clearing houses, and the increased centrality of these entities, increases the risk that an operational failure at one institution or entity may cause an industry-wide operational\\nfailure that could materially impact our ability to conduct business. Any such failure, termination or constraint could adversely affect our ability to effect transactions, service our clients, manage our exposure to risk or expand our businesses or\\nresult in financial loss or liability to our clients, impairment of our liquidity, disruption of our businesses, regulatory intervention or reputational damage.\\n\\nDespite the resiliency plans and facilities we have in place, our ability to conduct business\\nmay be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which we are located. This may include a disruption involving electrical, satellite, undersea cable or other communications,\\ninternet, transportation or other services facilities used by us, our employees or third parties with which we conduct business, including cloud service providers. These disruptions may occur as a result of events that affect only our buildings or\\nsystems or those of such third parties, or as a result of events with a broader impact globally, regionally or in the cities where those buildings or systems are located, including, but not limited to, natural disasters, war, civil unrest,\\nterrorism, economic or political developments, pandemics and weather events.

Furthermore,\\nGroup Inc. has guaranteed the payment obligations of certain of its subsidiaries, including GS&Co. and GS Bank USA, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, Group Inc. guarantees many of the obligations of its other consolidated subsidiaries\\non a transaction-by-transaction basis, as negotiated with counterparties. These guarantees may require Group Inc. to provide substantial funds or assets to its\\nsubsidiaries or their creditors or counterparties at a time when Group Inc. is in need of liquidity to fund its own obligations. The\\nrequirements for Group Inc. and GS Bank USA to develop and submit recovery and resolution plans to regulators, and the incorporation of feedback received from regulators, may require us to increase capital or liquidity levels or issue additional\\nlong-term debt at Group Inc. or particular subsidiaries or otherwise incur additional or duplicative operational or other costs at multiple entities, and may reduce our ability to provide Group Inc. guarantees of the obligations of our subsidiaries\\nor raise debt at Group Inc. Resolution planning may also impair our ability to structure our intercompany and external activities in a manner that we may otherwise deem most operationally efficient. Furthermore, arrangements to facilitate our\\nresolution planning may cause us to be subject to additional taxes. Any such limitations or requirements would be in addition to the legal and regulatory restrictions described above on our ability to engage in capital actions or make intercompany\\ndividends or payments.

It is possible that the application of the single point of entry strategy under OLA, in which Group Inc. would be the only entity to enter resolution proceedings (and its material broker-dealer, bank and other operating\\nentities would not enter resolution proceedings), would result in greater losses to Group Inc.\\x92s security holders (including holders of our fixed rate, floating rate and indexed debt securities), than the losses that would result from the\\napplication of a bankruptcy proceeding or a different resolution strategy, such as a multiple point of entry resolution strategy for Group Inc. and certain of its material subsidiaries.\\n\\nAssuming Group Inc. entered resolution proceedings and that support from Group Inc. to its\\nsubsidiaries was sufficient to enable the subsidiaries to remain solvent, losses at the subsidiary level would be transferred to Group Inc. and ultimately borne by Group Inc.\\x92s security holders, third-party creditors of Group Inc.\\x92s\\nsubsidiaries would receive full recoveries on their claims, and Group Inc.\\x92s security holders (including our shareholders, debtholders and other unsecured creditors) could face significant and possibly complete losses.

The strategy described in our resolution plan is a variant\\nof the single point of entry strategy: Group Inc. and Goldman Sachs Funding LLC (Funding IHC), a wholly-owned, direct subsidiary of Group Inc., would recapitalize and provide liquidity to certain major subsidiaries, including through the forgiveness\\nof intercompany indebtedness, the extension of the maturities of intercompany indebtedness and the extension of additional intercompany loans. If this strategy were successful, creditors of some or all of Group Inc.\\x92s major subsidiaries would\\nreceive full recoveries on their claims, while Group Inc.\\x92s security holders could face significant and possibly complete losses.  To\\nfacilitate the execution of our resolution plan, we formed Funding IHC, a wholly-owned, direct subsidiary of Group Inc.

AND SUBSIDIARIES \\n\\xa0\\n\\nWe are also subject to the risk that our rights against third parties may not be enforceable in\\nall circumstances. In addition, deterioration in the credit quality of third parties whose securities or obligations we hold, including a deterioration in the value of collateral posted by third parties to secure their obligations to us under\\nderivative contracts and loan agreements, could result in losses and/or adversely affect our ability to rehypothecate or otherwise use those securities or obligations for liquidity purposes. \\nA significant downgrade in the credit ratings of our counterparties could also have a negative impact on our results. While in many cases we\\nare permitted to require additional collateral from counterparties that experience financial difficulty, disputes may arise as to the amount of collateral we are entitled to receive and the value of pledged assets. The termination of contracts and\\nthe foreclosure on collateral may subject us to claims for the improper exercise of our rights. Default rates, downgrades and disputes with counterparties as to the valuation of collateral increase significantly in times of market stress and\\nilliquidity.  As part of our clearing and prime brokerage activities, we finance our clients\\x92 positions, and we could be held\\nresponsible for the defaults or misconduct of our clients. Although we regularly review credit exposures to specific clients and counterparties and to specific industries, countries and regions that we believe may present credit concerns, default\\nrisk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee.  Concentration of risk increases the potential for\\nsignificant losses in our market-making, underwriting, investing and lending activities.  Concentration of risk increases the\\npotential for significant losses in our market-making, underwriting, investing and lending activities. The number and size of such transactions may affect our results of operations in a given period. Moreover, because of concentration of risk, we\\nmay suffer losses even when economic and market conditions are generally favorable for our competitors. Disruptions in the credit markets can make it difficult to hedge these credit exposures effectively or economically. In addition, we extend large\\ncommitments as part of our credit origination activities.\\n\\nRules adopted under the Dodd-Frank Act, and similar rules adopted in other jurisdictions,\\nrequire issuers of certain asset-backed securities and any person who organizes and initiates certain asset-backed securities transactions to retain economic exposure to the asset, which has affected the cost of and structures used in connection\\nwith these securitization activities. Our inability to reduce our credit risk by selling, syndicating or securitizing these positions, including during periods of market stress, could negatively affect our results of operations due to a decrease in\\nthe fair value of the positions, including due to the insolvency or bankruptcy of the borrower, as well as the loss of revenues associated with selling such securities or loans. \\nIn the ordinary course of business, we may be subject to a concentration of credit risk to a particular counterparty, borrower, issuer,\\nincluding sovereign issuers, or geographic area or group of related countries, such as the E.U., and a failure or downgrade of, or default by, such entity could negatively impact our businesses, perhaps materially, and the systems by which we set\\nlimits and monitor the level of our credit exposure to individual entities, industries and countries may not function as we have anticipated. Regulatory reform, including the Dodd-Frank Act, has led to increased centralization of trading activity\\nthrough particular clearing houses, central agents or exchanges, which has significantly increased our concentration of risk with respect to these entities. While our activities expose us to many different industries, counterparties and countries,\\nwe routinely execute a high volume of transactions with counterparties engaged in financial services activities, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, clearing houses, exchanges and investment funds. This has resulted in significant\\ncredit concentration with respect to these counterparties.  The financial services industry is both highly competitive and interrelated.\\n The financial services industry and all of our businesses are intensely competitive, and we expect them to remain so. We compete\\non the basis of a number of factors, including transaction execution, our products and services, innovation, reputation, creditworthiness and price. There has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the financial services\\nindustry.

In the event that the composition of the underlier is significantly changed, by reference to rules governing\\nsuch underlier or otherwise, or the underlier ceases to exist (for example, in the event that LIBOR is discontinued, a country withdraws from the Euro or links its currency to or delinks its currency from another currency or benchmark, or an index\\nor ETF sponsor materially alters the composition of an index or ETF), there may be uncertainty as to the calculation of the amounts to be paid to the lender, investor or counterparty, depending on the terms of the governing instrument. Such changes in an underlier or underliers could result in our hedges being ineffective or otherwise result in losses on a product or having to\\npay more or receive less on securities that we own or have issued. In addition, such uncertainty could result in lengthy and costly litigation.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Press coverage and other public statements that assert some form of wrongdoing (including, in some cases, press\\ncoverage and public statements that do not directly involve us) often result in some type of investigation by regulators, legislators and law enforcement officials or in lawsuits. \\nResponding to these investigations and lawsuits, regardless of the ultimate outcome of the proceeding, is time-consuming and expensive and can\\ndivert the time and effort of our senior management from our business. Penalties and fines sought by regulatory authorities have increased substantially over the last several years, and certain regulators have been more likely in recent years to\\ncommence enforcement actions or to advance or support legislation targeted at the financial services industry. Adverse publicity, governmental scrutiny and legal and enforcement proceedings can also have a negative impact on our reputation and on\\nthe morale and performance of our employees, which could adversely affect our businesses and results of operations.

In addition, we rely on third-party suppliers or service providers to perform their contractual obligations and any failure on their part, including the failure to obtain raw materials at reasonable prices or to safely transport or store\\ncommodities, could expose us to costs or losses.

We may also be required to divest\\nor discontinue certain of these activities for regulatory or legal reasons. For example, the FRB has proposed regulations that could impose significant additional capital requirements on certain commodity-related activities. If that occurs, we may\\nreceive a value that is less than the then carrying value, as we may be unable to exit these activities in an orderly transaction.\\n\\nIn conducting our businesses around the world, we are subject to political, economic, legal,\\noperational and other risks that are inherent in operating in many countries.  In conducting our businesses and maintaining and\\nsupporting our global operations, we are subject to risks of possible nationalization, expropriation, price controls, capital controls, exchange controls and other restrictive governmental actions, as well as the outbreak of hostilities or acts of\\nterrorism. For example, sanctions have been imposed by the U.S. and the E.U. on certain individuals and companies in Russia. In many countries, the laws and regulations applicable to the securities and financial services industries and many of the\\ntransactions in which we are involved are uncertain and evolving, and it may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market. Any determination by local regulators that we have not acted in compliance with the\\napplication of local laws in a particular market or our failure to develop effective working relationships with local regulators could have a significant and negative effect not only on our businesses in that market, but also on our reputation\\ngenerally. Further, in some jurisdictions a failure to comply with laws and regulations may subject us and our personnel not only to civil actions, but also criminal actions. We are also subject to the enhanced risk that transactions we structure\\nmight not be legally enforceable in all cases.  In March\\xa02017, the U.K. notified the European Council of its decision to leave the\\nE.U. (Brexit). The exit of the U.K. from the E.U. will likely change the arrangements by which U.K. firms are able to provide services into the E.U., which may materially adversely affect the manner in which we operate certain of our businesses in\\nEurope and could require us to restructure certain of our operations. The outcome of the negotiations between the U.K. and the E.U. in connection with Brexit is highly uncertain. Such uncertainty may result in market volatility and may negatively\\nimpact the confidence of investors and clients. Additionally, depending on the outcome, Brexit could have a disproportionate effect on our operations in the E.U. compared to some of our competitors who have more extensive pre-existing operations in the E.U. outside of the U.K. \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGoldman\\xa0Sachs\\xa02017\\xa0Form 10-K\\n\\xa0\\n41\\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Compliance with these laws and regulations could require significant commitments of capital toward environmental monitoring, renovation of storage facilities or transport vessels, payment of emission fees and carbon or other taxes, and\\napplication for, and holding of, permits and licenses. Commodities involved in our intermediation activities and investments are also\\nsubject to the risk of unforeseen or catastrophic events, which are likely to be outside of our control, including those arising from the breakdown or failure of transport vessels, storage facilities or other equipment or processes or other\\nmechanical malfunctions, fires, leaks, spills or release of hazardous substances, performance below expected levels of output or efficiency, terrorist attacks, extreme weather events or other natural disasters or other hostile or catastrophic\\nevents. In addition, we rely on third-party suppliers or service providers to perform their contractual obligations and any failure on their part, including the failure to obtain raw materials at reasonable prices or to safely transport or store\\ncommodities, could expose us to costs or losses. Also, while we seek to insure against potential risks, we may not be able to obtain insurance to cover some of these risks and the insurance that we have may be inadequate to cover our losses. The occurrence of any of such events may prevent us from performing under our agreements with clients, may impair our operations or financial\\nresults and may result in litigation, regulatory action, negative publicity or other reputational harm. We may also be required to divest\\nor discontinue certain of these activities for regulatory or legal reasons. For example, the FRB has proposed regulations that could impose significant additional capital requirements on certain commodity-related activities. If that occurs, we may\\nreceive a value that is less than the then carrying value, as we may be unable to exit these activities in an orderly transaction.\\n\\nIn conducting our businesses around the world, we are subject to political, economic, legal,\\noperational and other risks that are inherent in operating in many countries.  In conducting our businesses and maintaining and\\nsupporting our global operations, we are subject to risks of possible nationalization, expropriation, price controls, capital controls, exchange controls and other restrictive governmental actions, as well as the outbreak of hostilities or acts of\\nterrorism. For example, sanctions have been imposed by the U.S. and the E.U. on certain individuals and companies in Russia. In many countries, the laws and regulations applicable to the securities and financial services industries and many of the\\ntransactions in which we are involved are uncertain and evolving, and it may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market. Any determination by local regulators that we have not acted in compliance with the\\napplication of local laws in a particular market or our failure to develop effective working relationships with local regulators could have a significant and negative effect not only on our businesses in that market, but also on our reputation\\ngenerally. Further, in some jurisdictions a failure to comply with laws and regulations may subject us and our personnel not only to civil actions, but also criminal actions. We are also subject to the enhanced risk that transactions we structure\\nmight not be legally enforceable in all cases.  In March\\xa02017, the U.K. notified the European Council of its decision to leave the\\nE.U. (Brexit). The exit of the U.K. from the E.U. will likely change the arrangements by which U.K. firms are able to provide services into the E.U., which may materially adversely affect the manner in which we operate certain of our businesses in\\nEurope and could require us to restructure certain of our operations. The outcome of the negotiations between the U.K. and the E.U. in connection with Brexit is highly uncertain. Such uncertainty may result in market volatility and may negatively\\nimpact the confidence of investors and clients. Additionally, depending on the outcome, Brexit could have a disproportionate effect on our operations in the E.U. compared to some of our competitors who have more extensive pre-existing operations in the E.U. outside of the U.K. In conducting our businesses around the world, we are subject to political, economic, legal,\\noperational and other risks that are inherent in operating in many countries. In conducting our businesses and maintaining and\\nsupporting our global operations, we are subject to risks of possible nationalization, expropriation, price controls, capital controls, exchange controls and other restrictive governmental actions, as well as the outbreak of hostilities or acts of\\nterrorism.

AND SUBSIDIARIES \\n\\xa0\\n\\nOur businesses and operations are increasingly expanding throughout the world, including in\\nemerging and growth markets, and we expect this trend to continue. Various emerging and growth market countries have experienced severe economic and financial disruptions, including significant devaluations of their currencies, defaults or\\nthreatened defaults on sovereign debt, capital and currency exchange controls, and low or negative growth rates in their economies, as well as military activity, civil unrest or acts of terrorism. The possible effects of any of these conditions\\ninclude an adverse impact on our businesses and increased volatility in financial markets generally.  While business and other practices\\nthroughout the world differ, our principal entities are subject in their operations worldwide to rules and regulations relating to corrupt and illegal payments, hiring practices and money laundering, as well as laws relating to doing business with\\ncertain individuals, groups and countries, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the USA PATRIOT Act and U.K. Bribery Act. While we have invested and continue to invest significant resources in training and in compliance monitoring, the\\ngeographical diversity of our operations, employees, clients and customers, as well as the vendors and other third parties that we deal with, greatly increases the risk that we may be found in violation of such rules or regulations and any such\\nviolation could subject us to significant penalties or adversely affect our reputation.  In addition, there have been a number of highly\\npublicized cases around the world, involving actual or alleged fraud or other misconduct by employees in the financial services industry in recent years, and we run the risk that employee misconduct could occur. This misconduct has included and may\\ninclude in the future the theft of proprietary information, including proprietary software. It is not always possible to deter or prevent employee misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity have not been and may not\\nbe effective in all cases.

The occurrence of unforeseen or catastrophic events,\\nincluding the emergence of a pandemic, such as the Ebola or Zika viruses, or other widespread health emergency (or concerns over the possibility of such an emergency), terrorist attacks, extreme terrestrial or solar weather events or other natural\\ndisasters, could create economic and financial disruptions, and could lead to operational difficulties (including travel limitations) that could impair our ability to manage our businesses. \\n\\nItem\\xa01B.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Unresolved Staff Comments \\nThere are no material unresolved written comments that were received from the SEC staff 180\\xa0days or more before the end of our fiscal year\\nrelating to our periodic or current reports under the Exchange Act.

In advanced economies, real GDP growth was higher in the U.S., the Euro area and Japan, but decreased slightly in the U.K. In emerging markets, real GDP growth increased slightly in China and appeared to decrease in India. Real GDP\\nappeared to grow in Russia and Brazil compared with contractions in 2016. Broadly, global macroeconomic data remained strong throughout 2017, and volatility in equity, fixed income, currency and commodity markets was low. Major elections were held\\nin France, the U.K., Germany and China, but none of these events resulted in significant volatility across markets. Major central banks continued to gradually tighten their stance on monetary policy, as the U.S. Federal Reserve increased its target\\ninterest rate three times and began the process of balance sheet normalization. In investment banking, industry-wide announced and completed mergers and acquisitions transactions remained solid during 2017, although volumes declined compared with\\n2016. Industry-wide offerings in equity underwriting increased significantly compared with 2016, and industry-wide debt underwriting offerings remained strong, particularly in leveraged finance activity. \\nUnited States  In the U.S., real GDP increased by\\n2.3% in 2017, compared with an increase of 1.5% in 2016, as growth in business fixed investment increased. Measures of consumer confidence were stronger on average compared with the prior year, and the unemployment rate declined to 4.1% as of\\nDecember\\xa02017. Housing starts, sales and prices increased compared with 2016, while measures of inflation were mixed. The U.S. Federal Reserve increased its target rate for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points at each of the March,\\nJune\\xa0and December\\xa0meetings to end the year at a target range of 1.25% to 1.50%. In September, the U.S. Federal Reserve formally announced the process of balance sheet normalization. Previously, the U.S. Federal Reserve reinvested all\\nproceeds from the maturity of bonds on its balance sheet, but since October\\xa02017, $6\\xa0billion of U.S. Treasury securities and $4\\xa0billion of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities matured each month without reinvestment of the\\nproceeds. These monthly allowances are expected to rise gradually over time to peak levels of $30\\xa0billion and $20\\xa0billion, respectively. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note decreased by 5\\nbasis points during 2017 to 2.40%. The price of natural gas decreased by 21% compared to the end of 2016 to $2.95 per\\xa0million British thermal units and the price of crude oil (WTI) increased by 12% to approximately $60 per barrel. In equity\\nmarkets, the NASDAQ Composite Index, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P\\xa0500 Index increased by 28%, 25% and 19%, respectively, during 2017.\\n\\nEurope \\nIn the Euro area, real GDP increased by 2.5% in 2017, compared with an increase of 1.7% in 2016. Net exports improved, while growth in consumer\\nspending and fixed investment slowed slightly. Measures of inflation remained subdued, prompting the European Central Bank (ECB) to announce an extension of its asset purchase program in the fourth quarter of 2017, although the pace of its monthly\\nasset purchases decreased from \\x8060\\xa0billion to \\x8030\\xa0billion beginning in January\\xa02018. The ECB maintained its main refinancing operations rate at 0.00% and its deposit rate at (0.40%). The Euro appreciated by 14% against the\\nU.S. dollar. Yields on 10-year government bonds in the Euro area generally increased during the year. In equity markets, the DAX Index, CAC 40 Index and Euro Stoxx 50 Index increased by 13%, 9% and 6%,\\nrespectively, during 2017. During 2017, the process of negotiating an arrangement for the withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U. began, resulting in an agreement on certain issues in December\\xa0as negotiations shifted to transitional arrangements.\\nIn the U.K., real GDP increased by 1.7% in 2017, compared with an increase of 1.9% in 2016. Inflation increased materially in 2017 prompting the Bank of England to raise the official bank rate by 25 basis points in November. The British pound\\nappreciated by 10% against the U.S. dollar during 2017. Yields on 10-year government bonds in the U.K. decreased slightly during the year and, in equity markets, the FTSE\\xa0100 Index increased by 8% during\\n2017.  Asia  In Japan, real GDP increased by\\n1.6% in 2017, compared with an increase of 0.9% in 2016. The Bank of Japan maintained its negative interest rate policy and continued to target a yield on 10-year Japanese government bonds of approximately 0%.\\nThe yield on 10-year Japanese government bonds was essentially unchanged, the U.S. dollar depreciated by 4% against the Japanese yen and the Nikkei 225 Index increased by 19% in 2017. In China, real GDP\\nincreased by 6.9% in 2017, compared with an increase of 6.7% in 2016. The People\\x92s Bank of China slightly tightened its stance on monetary policy in early 2017. Measures of inflation decreased and the U.S. dollar depreciated by 6% against the\\nChinese yuan. In equity markets, the Hang Seng Index and the Shanghai Composite Index increased by 36% and 7%, respectively, during 2017. In India, real GDP appeared to increase by 6.2% in 2017, compared with an increase of 7.9% in 2016, and the\\nrate of inflation decreased compared with 2016. The U.S. dollar depreciated by 6% against the Indian rupee and the BSE Sensex Index increased by 28% during 2017.\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGoldman\\xa0Sachs\\xa02017\\xa0Form 10-K\\n\\xa0\\n47\\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

United States In the U.S., real GDP increased by\\n2.3% in 2017, compared with an increase of 1.5% in 2016, as growth in business fixed investment increased. Measures of consumer confidence were stronger on average compared with the prior year, and the unemployment rate declined to 4.1% as of\\nDecember\\xa02017. Housing starts, sales and prices increased compared with 2016, while measures of inflation were mixed. The U.S. Federal Reserve increased its target rate for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points at each of the March,\\nJune\\xa0and December\\xa0meetings to end the year at a target range of 1.25% to 1.50%. In September, the U.S. Federal Reserve formally announced the process of balance sheet normalization. Previously, the U.S. Federal Reserve reinvested all\\nproceeds from the maturity of bonds on its balance sheet, but since October\\xa02017, $6\\xa0billion of U.S. Treasury securities and $4\\xa0billion of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities matured each month without reinvestment of the\\nproceeds. These monthly allowances are expected to rise gradually over time to peak levels of $30\\xa0billion and $20\\xa0billion, respectively. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note decreased by 5\\nbasis points during 2017 to 2.40%. The price of natural gas decreased by 21% compared to the end of 2016 to $2.95 per\\xa0million British thermal units and the price of crude oil (WTI) increased by 12% to approximately $60 per barrel.

Financial instruments owned and financial instruments sold, but not yet purchased (i.e., inventory), as well as certain other financial assets and financial liabilities,\\nare included in our consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value (i.e., marked-to-market), with related gains or losses generally recognized in our\\nconsolidated statements of earnings. The use of fair value to measure financial instruments is fundamental to our risk management practices and is our most critical accounting policy. \\nThe fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly\\ntransaction between market participants at the measurement date. We measure certain financial assets and financial liabilities as a portfolio (i.e., based on its net exposure to market and/or credit risks).\\xa0In determining fair value, the\\nhierarchy under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) gives (i)\\xa0the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities (level\\xa01 inputs), (ii) the next\\npriority to inputs other than level\\xa01 inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly (level\\xa02 inputs), and (iii)\\xa0the lowest priority to inputs that cannot be observed in market activity (level\\xa03 inputs). In evaluating\\nthe significance of a valuation input, we consider, among other factors, a portfolio\\x92s net risk exposure to that input. Assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to their fair\\nvalue measurement.  The fair values for substantially all of our financial assets and financial liabilities are based on observable prices\\nand inputs and are classified in levels\\xa01 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Certain level\\xa02 and level\\xa03 financial assets and financial liabilities may require appropriate valuation adjustments that a market participant would require\\nto arrive at fair value for factors such as counterparty and our credit quality, funding risk, transfer restrictions, liquidity and bid/offer spreads.\\n\\nInstruments classified in level\\xa03 of the fair value hierarchy are those which require one\\nor more significant inputs that are not observable. As of December\\xa02017 and December\\xa02016, level\\xa03 financial assets represented 2.1% and 2.7%, respectively, of our total assets. See Notes\\xa05 through 8 to the consolidated financial\\nstatements for further information about level\\xa03 financial assets, including changes in level\\xa03 financial assets and related fair value measurements. Absent evidence to the contrary, instruments classified in level\\xa03 of the fair value\\nhierarchy are initially valued at transaction price, which is considered to be the best initial estimate of fair value. Subsequent to the transaction date, we use other methodologies to determine fair value, which vary based on the type of\\ninstrument. Estimating the fair value of level\\xa03 financial instruments requires judgments to be made. These judgments include:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Determining the appropriate valuation methodology and/or model for each type of level\\xa03 financial\\ninstrument;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Determining model inputs based on an evaluation of all relevant empirical market data, including prices\\nevidenced by market transactions, interest rates, credit spreads, volatilities and correlations; and  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Determining appropriate valuation adjustments, including those related to illiquidity or counterparty credit\\nquality.

Our independent model risk management group (Model Risk Management), consisting of quantitative professionals who are separate from model developers, performs an independent model review and validation process of\\nour valuation models. New or changed models are reviewed and approved prior to being put into use. Models are evaluated and re-approved annually to assess the impact of any changes in the product or market and\\nany market developments in pricing theories. See \\x93Risk Management\\xa0\\x97 Model Risk Management\\x94 for further information about the review and validation of our valuation models. \\nGoodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets  Goodwill. Goodwill is the cost of acquired companies in excess of the fair value of net assets, including identifiable intangible assets, at the acquisition date.\\n Goodwill is assessed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that\\nindicate an impairment may exist. When assessing goodwill for impairment, first, qualitative factors are assessed to determine whether it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its estimated carrying\\nvalue. If the results of the qualitative assessment are not conclusive, a quantitative goodwill test is performed by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its estimated carrying value. \\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, we assessed goodwill for impairment for each of our reporting units by performing a qualitative assessment. The\\nqualitative assessment required management to make judgments and to evaluate several factors, which included, but were not limited to, performance indicators, firm and industry events, macroeconomic indicators and fair value indicators. Based on our\\nevaluation of these factors, we determined that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its respective estimated carrying value. Therefore, we determined that goodwill for each reporting unit\\nwas not impaired and that a quantitative goodwill test was not required.  See Note\\xa013 to the consolidated financial statements for\\nfurther information about our goodwill.  Estimating the fair value of our reporting units requires management to make judgments. Critical\\ninputs to the fair value estimates include projected earnings and attributed equity. There is inherent uncertainty in the projected earnings. The estimated net book value of each reporting unit reflects an allocation of total shareholders\\x92\\nequity and represents the estimated amount of total shareholders\\x92 equity required to support the activities of the reporting unit under currently applicable regulatory capital requirements. See \\x93Equity Capital Management and Regulatory\\nCapital\\x94 for further information about our capital requirements. \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGoldman\\xa0Sachs\\xa02017\\xa0Form 10-K\\n\\xa0\\n49\\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Our independent model risk management group (Model Risk Management), consisting of quantitative professionals who are separate from model developers, performs an independent model review and validation process of\\nour valuation models. New or changed models are reviewed and approved prior to being put into use. Models are evaluated and re-approved annually to assess the impact of any changes in the product or market and\\nany market developments in pricing theories. See \\x93Risk Management\\xa0\\x97 Model Risk Management\\x94 for further information about the review and validation of our valuation models. \\nGoodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets  Goodwill. Goodwill is the cost of acquired companies in excess of the fair value of net assets, including identifiable intangible assets, at the acquisition date.\\n Goodwill is assessed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that\\nindicate an impairment may exist. When assessing goodwill for impairment, first, qualitative factors are assessed to determine whether it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its estimated carrying\\nvalue. If the results of the qualitative assessment are not conclusive, a quantitative goodwill test is performed by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its estimated carrying value. \\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, we assessed goodwill for impairment for each of our reporting units by performing a qualitative assessment. The\\nqualitative assessment required management to make judgments and to evaluate several factors, which included, but were not limited to, performance indicators, firm and industry events, macroeconomic indicators and fair value indicators. Based on our\\nevaluation of these factors, we determined that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its respective estimated carrying value. Therefore, we determined that goodwill for each reporting unit\\nwas not impaired and that a quantitative goodwill test was not required.  See Note\\xa013 to the consolidated financial statements for\\nfurther information about our goodwill.  Estimating the fair value of our reporting units requires management to make judgments. Critical\\ninputs to the fair value estimates include projected earnings and attributed equity. There is inherent uncertainty in the projected earnings. The estimated net book value of each reporting unit reflects an allocation of total shareholders\\x92\\nequity and represents the estimated amount of total shareholders\\x92 equity required to support the activities of the reporting unit under currently applicable regulatory capital requirements.

During 2017, generally higher asset prices and tighter credit spreads were supportive of industry-wide underwriting activities, investment management performance and other principal transactions. However, low\\nlevels of volatility in equity, fixed income, currency and commodity markets continued to negatively affect our market-making activities, particularly in fixed income, currency and commodity products. The price of natural gas decreased significantly\\nduring 2017, while the price of oil increased compared with the end of 2016.  If the trend of low volatility continues over the long\\nterm and market-making activity levels remain low, or if investment banking activity levels, asset prices or assets under supervision decline, net revenues would likely be negatively impacted. See \\x93Segment Operating Results\\x94 below for\\nfurther information about the operating environment and material trends and uncertainties that may impact our results of operations.  The\\nfirst half of 2016 included challenging trends in the operating environment for our business activities including concerns and uncertainties about global economic growth, central bank activity and the political uncertainty and economic implications\\nsurrounding the potential exit of the U.K. from the E.U. During the second half of 2016, the operating environment improved, as global equity markets steadily increased and investment grade and high-yield credit spreads tightened. These trends\\nprovided a more favorable backdrop for our business activities.  2017 versus 2016 \\nNet revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $32.07\\xa0billion for 2017, 5% higher than 2016, due to significantly higher\\nother principal transactions revenues, and higher investment banking revenues, investment management revenues and net interest income. These increases were partially offset by significantly lower market making revenues and lower commissions and\\nfees.  Non-Interest Revenues. Investment banking revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $7.37\\xa0billion for 2017, 18% higher than 2016. Revenues in financial advisory were higher compared with 2016, reflecting an increase\\nin completed mergers and acquisitions transactions.

AND SUBSIDIARIES \\nManagement\\x92s Discussion and Analysis  \\xa0\\n\\nInvestment management revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were\\n$5.80\\xa0billion for 2017, 7% higher than 2016, due to higher management and other fees, reflecting higher average assets under supervision, and higher transaction revenues. \\nCommissions and fees in the consolidated statements of earnings were $3.05\\xa0billion for 2017, 5% lower than 2016, reflecting a decline in\\nour listed cash equity volumes in the U.S. Market volumes in the U.S. also declined.  Market making revenues in the consolidated statements\\nof earnings were $7.66\\xa0billion for 2017, 23% lower than 2016, due to significantly lower revenues in commodities, currencies, credit products, interest rate products and equity derivative products. These results were partially offset by\\nsignificantly higher revenues in equity cash products and significantly improved results in mortgages.   Other principal\\ntransactions revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $5.26\\xa0billion for 2017, 64% higher than 2016, primarily reflecting a significant increase in net gains from private equities, which were positively impacted by\\ncompany-specific events and corporate performance. In addition, net gains from public equities were significantly higher, as global equity prices increased during the year. \\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income in the\\nconsolidated statements of earnings was $2.93\\xa0billion for 2017, 13% higher than 2016, reflecting an increase in interest income primarily due to the impact of higher interest rates on collateralized agreements, higher interest income from loans\\nreceivable due to higher yields and an increase in total average loans receivable, an increase in total average financial instruments owned, and the impact of higher interest rates on other interest-earning assets and deposits with banks. The\\nincrease in interest income was partially offset by higher interest expense primarily due to the impact of higher interest rates on other interest-bearing liabilities, an increase in total average long-term borrowings, and the impact of higher\\ninterest rates on interest-bearing deposits, short-term borrowings and collateralized financings. See \\x93Statistical Disclosures\\xa0\\x97 Distribution of Assets, Liabilities and Shareholders\\x92 Equity\\x94 for further information about our\\nsources of net interest income. \\n2016 versus 2015 \\nNet revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $30.61\\xa0billion for 2016, 9% lower than 2015, reflecting the impact of a\\nchallenging operating environment during the first half of 2016, particularly during the first quarter, although the environment improved during the second half of the year. The decrease in net revenues was primarily due to significantly lower other\\nprincipal transactions revenues and lower investment banking revenues, net interest income and investment management revenues. In addition, commissions and fees were slightly lower. These results were partially offset by slightly higher market\\nmaking revenues.  Non-Interest Revenues.

Net revenues in Underwriting were $4.18\\xa0billion, 25% higher than 2016, due to significantly higher net revenues in both debt underwriting, primarily reflecting an increase in\\nindustry-wide leveraged finance activity, and equity underwriting, reflecting an increase in industry-wide secondary offerings.  Operating\\nexpenses were $3.53\\xa0billion for 2017, 3% higher than 2016, due to increased compensation and benefits expenses, reflecting higher net revenues. Pre-tax earnings were $3.85\\xa0billion in 2017, 36% higher\\nthan 2016.  As of December\\xa02017, our investment banking transaction backlog increased compared with the end of 2016, due to\\nsignificantly higher estimated net revenues from potential debt underwriting transactions and significantly higher estimated net revenues from potential equity underwriting transactions, primarily in initial public offerings. These increases were\\npartially offset by lower estimated net revenues from potential advisory transactions, principally related to mergers and acquisitions. \\nOur investment banking transaction backlog represents an estimate of our future net revenues from investment banking transactions where we\\nbelieve that future revenue realization is more likely than not. We believe changes in our investment banking transaction backlog may be a useful indicator of client activity levels which, over the long term, impact our net revenues. However, the\\ntime frame for completion and corresponding revenue recognition of transactions in our backlog varies based on the nature of the assignment, as certain transactions may remain in our backlog for longer periods of time and others may enter and leave\\nwithin the same reporting period. In addition, our transaction backlog is subject to certain limitations, such as assumptions about the likelihood that individual client transactions will occur in the future. Transactions may be cancelled or\\nmodified, and transactions not included in the estimate may also occur.  2016 versus 2015. Net revenues in Investment Banking were $6.27\\xa0billion for 2016, 11% lower compared with a strong 2015. \\nNet revenues in Financial Advisory were $2.93\\xa0billion, 16% lower compared with a strong 2015, reflecting a decrease in industry-wide\\ntransactions. Net revenues in Underwriting were $3.34\\xa0billion, 6% lower compared with a strong 2015, due to significantly lower net revenues in equity underwriting, reflecting a decrease in industry-wide volumes.

Operating Environment.\\nLow volatility levels in equity, fixed income, currency and commodity markets were a consistent theme during 2017, impacting the operating environment for Institutional Client Services throughout the year. During 2017, average VIX declined to 11.10\\ncompared with 15.84 in 2016, U.S. and European interest rates experienced historically low volatility levels, and volatility in G-10 currencies were near 10-year lows.\\nThis continued to negatively affect client activity across businesses, particularly in FICC Client Execution for 2017.  Although\\nmarket-making conditions remained challenging, including the price of natural gas decreasing by 21% compared to the end of 2016 to $2.95 per\\xa0million British thermal units, there were some positives in the financial markets. Global equity\\nmarkets continued to increase, with the MSCI World Index up 22% during 2017, and credit spreads continued to generally tighten in 2017. In addition, the price of oil increased by 12% compared to the end of 2016 to approximately $60 per barrel (WTI).\\n If the trend of low volatility continues over the long term and activity levels remain low, net revenues in Institutional Client Services\\nwould likely continue to be negatively impacted. See \\x93Business Environment\\x94 above for further information about economic and market conditions in the global operating environment during the year. \\nThe first half of 2016 included challenging trends in the operating environment for Institutional Client Services including concerns and\\nuncertainties about global economic growth, central bank activity and the political uncertainty and economic implications surrounding the potential exit of the U.K. from the E.U. During the second half of 2016, the operating environment improved, as\\nglobal equity markets steadily increased and investment grade and high-yield credit spreads tightened. These trends drove improved client sentiment and market-making conditions during the second half of 2016.\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGoldman\\xa0Sachs\\xa02017\\xa0Form 10-K\\n\\xa0\\n59\\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The\\naverage effective management fee (which excludes non-asset-based fees) we earned on our assets under supervision was 35 basis points for both 2017 and 2016, and 39 basis points for 2015. \\nIn certain circumstances, we are also entitled to receive incentive fees based on a percentage of a fund\\x92s or a separately managed\\naccount\\x92s return, or when the return exceeds a specified benchmark or other performance targets.

Assets under supervision (AUS) include client assets\\nwhere we earn a fee for managing assets on a discretionary basis. This includes net assets in our mutual funds, hedge funds, credit funds and private equity funds (including real estate funds), and separately managed accounts for institutional and\\nindividual investors. Assets under supervision also include client assets invested with third-party managers, bank deposits and advisory relationships where we earn a fee for advisory and other services, but do not have investment discretion. Assets\\nunder supervision do not include the self-directed brokerage assets of our clients. Long-term assets under supervision represent assets under supervision excluding liquidity products. Liquidity products represent money market and bank deposit\\nassets.

See \\x93Equity Capital Management and Regulatory Capital\\xa0\\x97 Equity Capital Management\\x94 for information about our equity capital management\\nprocess.  Although our balance sheet fluctuates on a\\nday-to-day basis, our total assets at quarter-end and year-end dates are generally not\\nmaterially different from those occurring within our reporting periods.  In order to ensure appropriate risk management, we seek to\\nmaintain a sufficiently liquid balance sheet and have processes in place to dynamically manage our assets and liabilities which include (i)\\xa0balance sheet planning, (ii)\\xa0balance sheet limits, (iii)\\xa0monitoring of key metrics and\\n(iv)\\xa0scenario analyses.  Balance Sheet\\nPlanning. We prepare a balance sheet plan that combines our projected total assets and composition of assets with our expected funding sources over a three-year time horizon. This plan is reviewed\\nquarterly and may be adjusted in response to changing business needs or market conditions. The objectives of this planning process are:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n To develop our balance sheet projections, taking into account the general state of the financial markets and\\nexpected business activity levels, as well as regulatory requirements;  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n To allow business risk managers and managers from our independent control and support functions to objectively\\nevaluate balance sheet limit requests from business managers in the context of our overall balance sheet constraints, including our liability profile and equity capital levels, and key metrics; and \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n To inform the target amount, tenor and type of funding to raise, based on our projected assets and contractual\\nmaturities.  Business risk managers and managers from our independent control and support functions along with business\\nmanagers review current and prior period information and expectations for the year to prepare our balance sheet plan. The specific information reviewed includes asset and liability size and composition, limit utilization, risk and performance\\nmeasures, and capital usage. \\nOur consolidated balance sheet plan, including our balance sheets by business, funding\\nprojections, and projected key metrics, is reviewed and approved by the Firmwide Finance Committee. See \\x93Risk Management\\xa0\\x97 Overview and Structure of Risk Management\\x94 for an overview of our risk management structure. \\nBalance Sheet Limits. The Firmwide Finance Committee\\nhas the responsibility of reviewing and approving balance sheet limits. These limits are set at levels which are close to actual operating levels, rather than at levels which reflect our maximum risk appetite, in order to ensure prompt escalation\\nand discussion among business managers and managers in our independent control and support functions on a routine basis. The Firmwide Finance Committee reviews and approves balance sheet limits on a quarterly basis and may also approve changes in\\nlimits on a more frequent basis in response to changing business needs or market conditions. In addition, the Risk Governance Committee sets aged inventory limits for certain financial instruments as a disincentive to hold inventory over longer\\nperiods of time. Requests for changes in limits are evaluated after giving consideration to their impact on our key metrics. Compliance with limits is monitored on a daily basis by business risk managers, as well as managers in our independent\\ncontrol and support functions.  Monitoring of Key Metrics. We monitor key balance sheet metrics daily both by business and on a consolidated basis, including asset and liability size and composition, limit utilization and risk measures. We allocate assets to businesses\\nand review and analyze movements resulting from new business activity, as well as market fluctuations.  Scenario Analyses. We conduct various scenario analyses including as part of the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) and Dodd-Frank Act Stress Tests\\n(DFAST), as well as our resolution and recovery planning. See \\x93Equity Capital Management and Regulatory Capital\\xa0\\x97 Equity Capital Management\\x94 below for further information about these scenario analyses. These scenarios cover\\nshort-term and long-term time horizons using various macroeconomic and firm-specific assumptions, based on a range of economic scenarios. We use these analyses to assist us in developing our longer-term balance sheet management strategy, including\\nthe level and composition of assets, funding and equity capital.

See \\x93Risk Management\\xa0\\x97 Liquidity Risk Management\\x94 below for details on the composition and sizing of our GCLA. We also segregate cash and\\nsecurities for regulatory and other purposes related to client activity.

In addition, we make investments, directly and\\nindirectly through funds that we manage, in debt securities, loans, public and private equity securities, infrastructure, real estate entities and other investments. As of December\\xa02017, total equity included $2.07\\xa0billion of private\\nequity securities that were acquired during 2017.

We maintain liquidity to meet\\na broad range of potential cash outflows and collateral needs in a stressed environment. See \\x93Risk Management\\xa0\\x97 Liquidity Risk Management\\x94 below for details on the composition and sizing of our GCLA. We also segregate cash and\\nsecurities for regulatory and other purposes related to client activity.

In addition, we make investments, directly and\\nindirectly through funds that we manage, in debt securities, loans, public and private equity securities, infrastructure, real estate entities and other investments. As of December\\xa02017, total equity included $2.07\\xa0billion of private\\nequity securities that were acquired during 2017.

The\\nincrease in financial instruments owned primarily reflected higher client activity and an increase in available-for-sale securities in U.S. government and agency\\nobligations and corporate loans and debt securities, partially offset by the impact of currency movements on derivative valuations. The increase in loans receivable primarily reflected an increase in loans to corporate borrowers and loans backed by\\nreal estate. The increase in receivables from customers and counterparties reflected client activity.  As of December\\xa02017, total\\nliabilities in our consolidated statements of financial condition were $834.53\\xa0billion, an increase of $61.26\\xa0billion from December\\xa02016, primarily reflecting increases in unsecured long-term borrowings of $28.60\\xa0billion,\\ncollateralized financings of $23.44\\xa0billion and deposits of $14.51\\xa0billion, partially offset by a decrease in payables to customers and counterparties of $12.57\\xa0billion. The increase in unsecured long-term borrowings was primarily due\\nto net new issuances. The increase in collateralized financings reflected the impact of client and firm activity. The increase in deposits reflected increases in institutional deposits and Marcus deposits. The decrease in payables to customers and\\ncounterparties reflected client activity.  As of December\\xa02017 and December\\xa02016, our total securities sold under agreements to\\nrepurchase, accounted for as collateralized financings, were $84.72\\xa0billion and $71.82\\xa0billion, respectively, which were 2% lower and 5% lower than the daily average amount of repurchase agreements during the quarters ended\\nDecember\\xa02017 and December\\xa02016, respectively, and 1% lower and 9% lower than the daily average amount of repurchase agreements during the years ended December\\xa02017 and December\\xa02016, respectively. The decrease in our repurchase\\nagreements relative to the daily averages during 2017 and 2016 resulted from the impact of firm and client activity at the end of both years. \\nThe table below presents information about our balance sheet and our leverage ratios. \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nAs of December\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$ in\\xa0millions\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n2017\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n2016\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Total assets\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$916,776\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$860,165\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Unsecured long-term borrowings\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$217,687\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$189,086\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Total shareholders\\x92 equity\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\xa0\\xa082,243\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\xa0\\xa086,893\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Leverage ratio\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n11.1x\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n9.9x\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Debt to equity ratio\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n2.6x\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n2.2x\\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n66\\n\\xa0\\nGoldman\\xa0Sachs\\xa02017\\xa0Form 10-K\\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The\\nincrease in financial instruments owned primarily reflected higher client activity and an increase in available-for-sale securities in U.S. government and agency\\nobligations and corporate loans and debt securities, partially offset by the impact of currency movements on derivative valuations.

The increase in unsecured long-term borrowings was primarily due\\nto net new issuances. The increase in collateralized financings reflected the impact of client and firm activity. The increase in deposits reflected increases in institutional deposits and Marcus deposits. The decrease in payables to customers and\\ncounterparties reflected client activity.

Our funding is\\nprimarily raised in U.S. dollar, Euro, British pound and Japanese yen. We generally distribute our funding products through our own sales force and third-party distributors to a large, diverse creditor base in a variety of markets in the Americas,\\nEurope and Asia. We believe that our relationships with our creditors are critical to our liquidity. Our creditors include banks, governments, securities lenders, corporations, pension funds, insurance companies, mutual funds and individuals. We\\nhave imposed various internal guidelines to monitor creditor concentration across our funding programs. \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGoldman\\xa0Sachs\\xa02017\\xa0Form 10-K\\n\\xa0\\n67\\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

See Note\\xa015 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our unsecured short-term borrowings. \\nEquity Capital Management and Regulatory Capital \\nCapital adequacy is of critical importance to us. We have in place a comprehensive capital management policy that provides a framework, defines\\nobjectives and establishes guidelines to assist us in maintaining the appropriate level and composition of capital in both business-as-usual and stressed conditions.\\n Equity Capital Management  We determine the\\nappropriate level and composition of our equity capital by considering multiple factors including our current and future consolidated regulatory capital requirements, the results of our capital planning and stress testing process, resolution capital\\nmodels and other factors, such as rating agency guidelines, subsidiary capital requirements, the business environment and conditions in the financial markets. We manage our capital requirements and the levels of our capital usage principally by\\nsetting limits on balance sheet assets and/or limits on risk, in each case at both the consolidated and business levels.  We principally\\nmanage the level and composition of our equity capital through issuances and repurchases of our common stock. We may also, from time to time, issue or repurchase our preferred stock, junior subordinated debt issued to trusts, and other subordinated\\ndebt or other forms of capital as business conditions warrant. Prior to any repurchases, we must receive confirmation that the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board or FRB) does not object to such capital action.\\nSee Notes\\xa016 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our preferred stock, junior subordinated debt issued to trusts and other subordinated debt.\\n\\nCapital Planning and Stress Testing Process. As part of capital planning, we project sources and uses of capital given a range of business environments, including stressed conditions. Our stress testing process is designed to identify and measure material\\nrisks associated with our business activities including market risk, credit risk and operational risk, as well as our ability to generate revenues. \\nThe following is a description of our capital planning and stress testing process: \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Capital Planning. Our capital planning process incorporates an\\ninternal capital adequacy assessment with the objective of ensuring that we are appropriately capitalized relative to the risks in our businesses. We incorporate stress scenarios into our capital planning process with a goal of holding sufficient\\ncapital to ensure we remain adequately capitalized after experiencing a severe stress event. Our assessment of capital adequacy is viewed in tandem with our assessment of liquidity adequacy and is integrated into our overall risk management\\nstructure, governance and policy framework.  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n Our capital planning process also includes an internal risk-based capital assessment. This assessment incorporates market\\nrisk, credit risk and operational risk. Market risk is calculated by using Value-at-Risk (VaR) calculations supplemented by risk-based\\nadd-ons which include risks related to rare events (tail risks). Credit risk utilizes assumptions about our counterparties\\x92 probability of default and the size of our losses in the event of a default.\\nOperational risk is calculated based on scenarios incorporating multiple types of operational failures, as well as considering internal and external actual loss experience. Backtesting for market risk and credit risk is used to gauge the\\neffectiveness of models at capturing and measuring relevant risks.  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Stress Testing. Our stress tests incorporate our internally\\ndesigned stress scenarios, including our internally developed severely adverse scenario, and those required under CCAR and DFAST, and are designed to capture our specific vulnerabilities and risks. We provide further information about our stress\\ntest processes and a summary of the results on our website as described in \\x93Business\\xa0\\x97 Available Information\\x94 in Part\\xa0I, Item\\xa01 of this Form\\xa010-K. \\nAs required by the FRB\\x92s annual CCAR rules, we submit a capital plan for review by the FRB. The purpose of the FRB\\x92s review is to\\nensure that we have a robust, forward-looking capital planning process that accounts for our unique risks and that permits continued operation during times of economic and financial stress.\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGoldman\\xa0Sachs\\xa02017\\xa0Form 10-K\\n\\xa0\\n69\\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

We manage our capital requirements and the levels of our capital usage principally by\\nsetting limits on balance sheet assets and/or limits on risk, in each case at both the consolidated and business levels.  We principally\\nmanage the level and composition of our equity capital through issuances and repurchases of our common stock. We may also, from time to time, issue or repurchase our preferred stock, junior subordinated debt issued to trusts, and other subordinated\\ndebt or other forms of capital as business conditions warrant. Prior to any repurchases, we must receive confirmation that the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board or FRB) does not object to such capital action.\\nSee Notes\\xa016 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our preferred stock, junior subordinated debt issued to trusts and other subordinated debt.\\nUnsecured Short-Term Borrowings.

As part of capital planning, we project sources and uses of capital given a range of business environments, including stressed conditions. Our stress testing process is designed to identify and measure material\\nrisks associated with our business activities including market risk, credit risk and operational risk, as well as our ability to generate revenues. \\nThe following is a description of our capital planning and stress testing process: \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Capital Planning. Our capital planning process incorporates an\\ninternal capital adequacy assessment with the objective of ensuring that we are appropriately capitalized relative to the risks in our businesses. We incorporate stress scenarios into our capital planning process with a goal of holding sufficient\\ncapital to ensure we remain adequately capitalized after experiencing a severe stress event. Our assessment of capital adequacy is viewed in tandem with our assessment of liquidity adequacy and is integrated into our overall risk management\\nstructure, governance and policy framework.  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n Our capital planning process also includes an internal risk-based capital assessment. This assessment incorporates market\\nrisk, credit risk and operational risk. Market risk is calculated by using Value-at-Risk (VaR) calculations supplemented by risk-based\\nadd-ons which include risks related to rare events (tail risks). Credit risk utilizes assumptions about our counterparties\\x92 probability of default and the size of our losses in the event of a default.\\nOperational risk is calculated based on scenarios incorporating multiple types of operational failures, as well as considering internal and external actual loss experience. Backtesting for market risk and credit risk is used to gauge the\\neffectiveness of models at capturing and measuring relevant risks.  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Stress Testing. Our stress tests incorporate our internally\\ndesigned stress scenarios, including our internally developed severely adverse scenario, and those required under CCAR and DFAST, and are designed to capture our specific vulnerabilities and risks. We provide further information about our stress\\ntest processes and a summary of the results on our website as described in \\x93Business\\xa0\\x97 Available Information\\x94 in Part\\xa0I, Item\\xa01 of this Form\\xa010-K. \\nAs required by the FRB\\x92s annual CCAR rules, we submit a capital plan for review by the FRB. The purpose of the FRB\\x92s review is to\\nensure that we have a robust, forward-looking capital planning process that accounts for our unique risks and that permits continued operation during times of economic and financial stress.\\nCapital Planning and Stress Testing Process.

AND SUBSIDIARIES \\nManagement\\x92s Discussion and Analysis  \\xa0\\n\\nThe FRB evaluates us based, in part, on whether we have the capital necessary to continue\\noperating under the baseline and stress scenarios provided by the FRB and those developed internally. This evaluation also takes into account our process for identifying risk, our controls and governance for capital planning, and our guidelines for\\nmaking capital planning decisions. In addition, the FRB evaluates our plan to make capital distributions (i.e., dividend payments and repurchases or redemptions of stock, subordinated debt or other capital securities) and issue capital, across a\\nrange of macroeconomic scenarios and firm-specific assumptions.  In addition, the DFAST rules require us to conduct stress tests on a\\nsemi-annual basis and publish a summary of certain results. The FRB also conducts its own annual stress tests and publishes a summary of certain results. \\nWith respect to our 2017 CCAR submission, the FRB informed us that it did not object to our capital actions. These capital actions included the\\npotential to repurchase outstanding common stock of up to $8.70\\xa0billion, and the potential to issue and redeem other capital securities over the twelve-month period beginning July\\xa02017, and the potential to increase our common stock\\ndividend by up to $0.05 per share in the second quarter of 2018. However, we do not expect that we will utilize our entire share repurchase authorization by June\\xa02018. The amount and timing of our capital actions will be based on, among other\\nthings, our current and projected capital position, and capital deployment opportunities. We published a summary of our annual DFAST results in June\\xa02017. See \\x93Business\\xa0\\x97 Available Information\\x94 in Part\\xa0I, Item 1 of this\\nForm\\xa010-K.

As part of our comprehensive\\ncapital management policy, we maintain a contingency capital plan. Our contingency capital plan provides a framework for analyzing and responding to a perceived or actual capital deficiency, including, but not limited to, identification of drivers\\nof a capital deficiency, as well as mitigants and potential actions. It outlines the appropriate communication procedures to follow during a crisis period, including internal dissemination of information, as well as timely communication with\\nexternal stakeholders.  Capital Attribution.\\nWe assess each of our businesses\\x92 capital usage based upon our internal assessment of risks, which incorporates an attribution of all of our relevant regulatory capital requirements. These regulatory capital requirements are allocated using our\\nattributed equity framework, which takes into consideration our binding capital constraints. We also attribute risk-weighted assets (RWAs) to our business segments. As of December\\xa02017, approximately 60% and 55% of RWAs calculated in accordance\\nwith the Standardized Capital Rules and the Basel\\xa0III Advanced Rules, respectively, subject to transitional provisions, were attributed to our Institutional Client Services segment and substantially all of the remaining RWAs were attributed to\\nour Investing\\xa0& Lending segment. We manage the levels of our capital usage based upon balance sheet and risk limits, as well as capital return analyses of our businesses based on our capital attribution. \\nShare Repurchase Program. We use our share repurchase\\nprogram to help maintain the appropriate level of common equity. The repurchase program is effected primarily through regular open-market purchases (which may include repurchase plans designed to comply with\\nRule\\xa010b5-1), the amounts and timing of which are determined primarily by our current and projected capital position and our capital plan submitted to the FRB as part of CCAR.

The level and composition of our equity capital are among the many factors considered in\\ndetermining our credit ratings. Each agency has its own definition of eligible capital and methodology for evaluating capital adequacy, and assessments are generally based on a combination of factors rather than a single calculation.

See Note\\xa020 to the consolidated financial statements for information about the capital requirements of our other regulated subsidiaries. \\nSubsidiaries not subject to separate regulatory capital requirements may hold capital to satisfy local tax and legal guidelines, rating agency\\nrequirements (for entities with assigned credit ratings) or internal policies, including policies concerning the minimum amount of capital a subsidiary should hold based on its underlying level of risk. In certain instances, Group Inc. may be\\nlimited in its ability to access capital held at certain subsidiaries as a result of regulatory, tax or other constraints. As of December\\xa02017 and December\\xa02016, Group Inc.\\x92s equity investment in subsidiaries was $93.88\\xa0billion\\nand $92.77\\xa0billion, respectively, compared with its total shareholders\\x92 equity of $82.24\\xa0billion and $86.89\\xa0billion, respectively. \\nOur capital invested in non-U.S. subsidiaries is generally exposed to foreign exchange risk,\\nsubstantially all of which is managed through a combination of derivatives and non-U.S. denominated debt. See Note\\xa07 to the consolidated financial statements for information about our net investment\\nhedges, which are used to hedge this risk.  Guarantees of Subsidiaries. Group Inc. has guaranteed the payment obligations of GS&Co. and GS Bank USA, in each case subject to certain exceptions.\\nIn November\\xa02016, the European Commission proposed amendments to the CRR to implement a 3%\\nminimum leverage ratio requirement for certain E.U. financial institutions. This leverage ratio compares the CRR\\x92s definition of Tier\\xa01 capital to a measure of leverage exposure, defined as the sum of certain assets plus certain off-balance-sheet exposures (which include a measure of derivatives, securities financing transactions, commitments and guarantees), less Tier\\xa01 capital deductions. Any required minimum leverage ratio is\\nexpected to become effective for GSI no earlier than January\\xa01,\\xa02021. As of December\\xa02017 and December\\xa02016, GSI had a leverage ratio of 4.1% and 3.8%, respectively. The ratio as of December\\xa02017 included approximately 20\\nbasis points attributable to amounts which will be finalized upon the issuance of GSI\\x92s 2017 annual audited financial statements. This leverage ratio is based on our current interpretation and understanding of this rule and may evolve as we\\ndiscuss the interpretation and application of this rule with GSI\\x92s regulators.

AND SUBSIDIARIES \\nManagement\\x92s Discussion and Analysis  \\xa0\\n\\nProcesses. We maintain various processes and procedures\\nthat are critical components of our risk management framework, including identifying, assessing, monitoring and limiting our risks. \\nTo effectively assess and monitor our risks, we maintain a daily discipline of marking substantially all of our inventory to current market\\nlevels. We carry our inventory at fair value, with changes in valuation reflected immediately in our risk management systems and in net revenues. We do so because we believe this discipline is one of the most effective tools for assessing and\\nmanaging risk and that it provides transparent and realistic insight into our inventory exposures.  We also apply a rigorous framework of\\nlimits and thresholds to control and monitor risk across transactions, products, businesses and markets. The Board, directly or indirectly, through its Risk Committee, approves limits and thresholds, included in our risk appetite statement, at\\nfirmwide, business and product levels. In addition, the Firmwide Risk Committee is responsible for approving our risk limits framework, subject to the overall limits approved by the Risk Committee of the Board, at a variety of levels and monitoring\\nthese limits on a daily basis. The Risk Governance Committee (through delegated authority from the Firmwide Risk Committee) is responsible for approving limits at firmwide, business and product levels. Certain limits may be set at levels that will\\nrequire periodic adjustment, rather than at levels which reflect our maximum risk appetite. This fosters an ongoing dialogue on risk among revenue-producing units, independent control and support functions, committees and senior management, as well\\nas rapid escalation of risk-related matters. See \\x93Liquidity Risk Management,\\x94 \\x93Market Risk Management\\x94 and \\x93Credit Risk Management\\x94 for further information about our risk limits.\\n Active management of our positions is another important process. Proactive mitigation of our market and credit exposures minimizes the\\nrisk that we will be required to take outsized actions during periods of stress.  Effective risk reporting and risk decision-making depends\\non our ability to get the right information to the right people at the right time. As such, we focus on the rigor and effectiveness of our risk systems, with the objective of ensuring that our risk management technology systems are comprehensive,\\nreliable and timely. We devote significant time and resources to our risk management technology to ensure that it consistently provides us with complete, accurate and timely information. \\n\\nPeople.\\nEven the best technology serves only as a tool for helping to make informed decisions in real time about the risks we are taking. Ultimately, effective risk management requires our people to interpret our risk data on an ongoing and timely basis and\\nadjust risk positions accordingly. In both our revenue-producing units and our independent control and support functions, the experience of our professionals, and their understanding of the nuances and limitations of each risk measure, guide us in\\nassessing exposures and maintaining them within prudent levels.   We reinforce a culture of effective risk management,\\nconsistent with our risk appetite statement, in our training and development programs, as well as the way we evaluate performance, and recognize and reward our people. Our training and development programs, including certain sessions led by our most\\nsenior leaders, are focused on the importance of risk management, client relationships and reputational excellence. As part of our annual performance review process, we assess reputational excellence including how an employee exercises good risk\\nmanagement and reputational judgment, and adheres to our code of conduct and compliance policies. Our review and reward processes are designed to communicate and reinforce to our professionals the link between behavior and how people are recognized,\\nthe need to focus on our clients and our reputation, and the need to always act in accordance with our highest standards.  Structure \\nUltimate oversight of risk is the responsibility of our Board. The Board oversees risk both directly and through its committees, including its\\nRisk Committee. We have a series of committees with specific risk management mandates that have oversight or decision-making responsibilities for risk management activities. Committee membership generally consists of senior managers from both our\\nrevenue-producing units and our independent control and support functions. We have established procedures for these committees to ensure that appropriate information barriers are in place. Our primary risk committees, most of which also have\\nadditional sub-committees or working groups, are described below. In addition to these committees, we have other risk-oriented committees which provide oversight for different businesses, activities, products,\\nregions and entities. All of our committees have responsibility for considering the impact of transactions and activities, which they oversee, on our reputation. \\nMembership of our risk committees is reviewed regularly and updated to reflect changes in the responsibilities of the committee members.\\nAccordingly, the length of time that members serve on the respective committees varies as determined by the committee chairs and based on the responsibilities of the members.\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n78\\n\\xa0\\nGoldman\\xa0Sachs\\xa02017\\xa0Form 10-K\\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

This fosters an ongoing dialogue on risk among revenue-producing units, independent control and support functions, committees and senior management, as well\\nas rapid escalation of risk-related matters.

Proactive mitigation of our market and credit exposures minimizes the\\nrisk that we will be required to take outsized actions during periods of stress.  Effective risk reporting and risk decision-making depends\\non our ability to get the right information to the right people at the right time. As such, we focus on the rigor and effectiveness of our risk systems, with the objective of ensuring that our risk management technology systems are comprehensive,\\nreliable and timely. We devote significant time and resources to our risk management technology to ensure that it consistently provides us with complete, accurate and timely information. \\nProcesses. We maintain various processes and procedures\\nthat are critical components of our risk management framework, including identifying, assessing, monitoring and limiting our risks. To effectively assess and monitor our risks, we maintain a daily discipline of marking substantially all of our inventory to current market\\nlevels. We carry our inventory at fair value, with changes in valuation reflected immediately in our risk management systems and in net revenues. We do so because we believe this discipline is one of the most effective tools for assessing and\\nmanaging risk and that it provides transparent and realistic insight into our inventory exposures. We also apply a rigorous framework of\\nlimits and thresholds to control and monitor risk across transactions, products, businesses and markets. The Board, directly or indirectly, through its Risk Committee, approves limits and thresholds, included in our risk appetite statement, at\\nfirmwide, business and product levels. In addition, the Firmwide Risk Committee is responsible for approving our risk limits framework, subject to the overall limits approved by the Risk Committee of the Board, at a variety of levels and monitoring\\nthese limits on a daily basis.

We have established procedures for these committees to ensure that appropriate information barriers are in place. Our primary risk committees, most of which also have\\nadditional sub-committees or working groups, are described below. In addition to these committees, we have other risk-oriented committees which provide oversight for different businesses, activities, products,\\nregions and entities. All of our committees have responsibility for considering the impact of transactions and activities, which they oversee, on our reputation. \\nMembership of our risk committees is reviewed regularly and updated to reflect changes in the responsibilities of the committee members.\\nAccordingly, the length of time that members serve on the respective committees varies as determined by the committee chairs and based on the responsibilities of the members.\\nPeople.\\nEven the best technology serves only as a tool for helping to make informed decisions in real time about the risks we are taking.

AND SUBSIDIARIES \\nManagement\\x92s Discussion and Analysis  \\xa0\\nLiquidity Risk Management \\n\\xa0\\nOverview \\nLiquidity risk is the risk that we will be unable to fund the firm or meet our liquidity needs in the event of firm-specific, broader industry,\\nor market liquidity stress events. Liquidity is of critical importance to us, as most of the failures of financial institutions have occurred in large part due to insufficient liquidity. Accordingly, we have in place a comprehensive and conservative\\nset of liquidity and funding policies. Our principal objective is to be able to fund the firm and to enable our core businesses to continue to serve clients and generate revenues, even under adverse circumstances. \\nTreasury has the primary responsibility for assessing, monitoring and managing our liquidity and funding strategy. Treasury is independent of\\nthe revenue-producing units and reports to our chief financial officer.  Liquidity Risk Management is an independent risk management\\nfunction responsible for control and oversight of our liquidity risk management framework, including stress testing and limit governance. Liquidity Risk Management is independent of the revenue-producing units and Treasury, and reports to our chief\\nrisk officer.  Liquidity Risk Management Principles \\nWe manage liquidity risk according to three principles (i)\\xa0hold sufficient excess liquidity in the form of GCLA to cover outflows during a\\nstressed period, (ii)\\xa0maintain appropriate Asset-Liability Management and (iii)\\xa0maintain a viable Contingency Funding Plan.  Global Core Liquid Assets. GCLA is liquidity that we maintain to meet a broad range of potential cash outflows and collateral needs in a stressed environment. Our most\\nimportant liquidity policy is to pre-fund our estimated potential cash and collateral needs during a liquidity crisis and hold this liquidity in the form of unencumbered, highly liquid securities and cash. We\\nbelieve that the securities held in our GCLA would be readily convertible to cash in a matter of days, through liquidation, by entering into repurchase agreements or from maturities of resale agreements, and that this cash would allow us to meet\\nimmediate obligations without needing to sell other assets or depend on additional funding from credit-sensitive markets.  Our GCLA\\nreflects the following principles:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n The first days or weeks of a liquidity crisis are the most critical to a company\\x92s survival;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Focus must be maintained on all potential cash and collateral outflows, not just disruptions to financing\\nflows. Our businesses are diverse, and our liquidity needs are determined by many factors, including market movements, collateral requirements and client commitments, all of which can change dramatically in a difficult funding environment;\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n During a liquidity crisis, credit-sensitive funding, including unsecured debt, certain deposits and some types\\nof secured financing agreements, may be unavailable, and the terms (e.g., interest rates, collateral provisions and tenor) or availability of other types of secured financing may change and certain deposits may be withdrawn; and\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n As a result of our policy to pre-fund liquidity that we estimate may\\nbe needed in a crisis, we hold more unencumbered securities and have larger debt balances than our businesses would otherwise require. We believe that our liquidity is stronger with greater balances of highly liquid unencumbered securities, even\\nthough it increases our total assets and our funding costs.  We maintain our GCLA across Group Inc., Funding IHC and\\nGroup Inc.\\x92s major broker-dealer and bank subsidiaries, asset types, and clearing agents to provide us with sufficient operating liquidity to ensure timely settlement in all major markets, even in a difficult funding environment. In addition to\\nthe GCLA, we maintain cash balances and securities in several of our other entities, primarily for use in specific currencies, entities, or jurisdictions where we do not have immediate access to parent company liquidity. \\nWe believe that our GCLA provides us with a resilient source of funds that would be available in advance of potential cash and collateral\\noutflows and gives us significant flexibility in managing through a difficult funding environment. \\nAsset-Liability Management. Our liquidity risk\\nmanagement policies are designed to ensure we have a sufficient amount of financing, even when funding markets experience persistent stress. We manage the maturities and diversity of our funding across markets, products and counterparties, and seek\\nto maintain a diversified funding profile with an appropriate tenor, taking into consideration the characteristics and liquidity profile of our assets. \\nOur approach to asset-liability management includes:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Conservatively managing the overall characteristics of our funding book, with a focus on maintaining\\nlong-term, diversified sources of funding in excess of our current requirements.

We assess our funding requirements and our ability to liquidate assets in a stressed environment while appropriately managing risk. This enables us to determine the most appropriate funding products and\\ntenors. See \\x93Balance Sheet and Funding Sources\\xa0\\x97 Balance Sheet Management\\x94 for further details on our balance sheet management process and \\x93\\x97\\xa0Funding Sources\\xa0\\x97 Secured Funding\\x94 for further details on\\nasset classes that may be harder to fund on a secured basis; and  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Raising secured and unsecured financing that has a long tenor relative to the liquidity profile of our assets.\\nThis reduces the risk that our liabilities will come due in advance of our ability to generate liquidity from the sale of our assets. Because we maintain a highly liquid balance sheet, the holding period of certain of our assets may be materially\\nshorter than their contractual maturity dates.  Our goal is to ensure that we maintain sufficient liquidity to fund our\\nassets and meet our contractual and contingent obligations in normal times, as well as during periods of market stress. Through our dynamic balance sheet management process, we use actual and projected asset balances to determine secured and\\nunsecured funding requirements. Funding plans are reviewed and approved by the Firmwide Finance Committee on a quarterly basis. In addition, senior managers in our independent control and support functions regularly analyze, and the Firmwide Finance\\nCommittee reviews, our consolidated total capital position (unsecured long-term borrowings plus total shareholders\\x92 equity) so that we maintain a level of long-term funding that is sufficient to meet our long-term financing requirements. In a\\nliquidity crisis, we would first use our GCLA in order to avoid reliance on asset sales (other than our GCLA). However, we recognize that orderly asset sales may be prudent or necessary in a severe or persistent liquidity crisis. \\nSubsidiary Funding Policies  The majority of\\nour unsecured funding is raised by Group Inc., which lends the necessary funds to Funding IHC and other subsidiaries, some of which are regulated, to meet their asset financing, liquidity and capital requirements. In addition, Group Inc. provides\\nits regulated subsidiaries with the necessary capital to meet their regulatory requirements. The benefits of this approach to subsidiary funding are enhanced control and greater flexibility to meet the funding requirements of our subsidiaries.\\nFunding is also raised at the subsidiary level through a variety of products, including deposits, secured funding and unsecured borrowings.\\n\\nOur intercompany funding policies assume that a subsidiary\\x92s funds or securities are not\\nfreely available to its parent, Funding IHC or other subsidiaries unless (i)\\xa0legally provided for and (ii)\\xa0there are no additional regulatory, tax or other restrictions. In particular, many of our subsidiaries are subject to laws that\\nauthorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to Group Inc. or Funding IHC. Regulatory action of that kind could impede access to funds that Group Inc. needs to make payments on its obligations.\\nAccordingly, we assume that the capital provided to our regulated subsidiaries is not available to Group Inc. or other subsidiaries and any other financing provided to our regulated subsidiaries is not available to Group Inc. or Funding IHC until\\nthe maturity of such financing.  Group Inc. has provided substantial amounts of equity and subordinated indebtedness, directly or\\nindirectly, to its regulated subsidiaries. For example, as of December\\xa02017, Group Inc. had $29.60\\xa0billion of equity and subordinated indebtedness invested in GS&Co., its principal U.S. registered broker-dealer; $37.19\\xa0billion\\ninvested in GSI, a regulated U.K. broker-dealer; $2.69\\xa0billion invested in GSJCL, a regulated Japanese broker-dealer; $27.56\\xa0billion invested in GS Bank USA, a regulated New York State-chartered bank; and $3.86\\xa0billion invested in\\nGSIB, a regulated U.K. bank. Group Inc. also provided, directly or indirectly, $114.98\\xa0billion of unsubordinated loans (including secured loans of $50.59\\xa0billion), and $13.38\\xa0billion of collateral and cash deposits to these entities,\\nsubstantially all of which was to GS&Co., GSI, GSJCL and GS Bank USA, as of December\\xa02017. In addition, as of December\\xa02017, Group Inc. had significant amounts of capital invested in and loans to its other regulated subsidiaries. \\nContingency Funding Plan. We maintain a contingency\\nfunding plan to provide a framework for analyzing and responding to a liquidity crisis situation or periods of market stress. Our contingency funding plan outlines a list of potential risk factors, key reports and metrics that are reviewed on an\\nongoing basis to assist in assessing the severity of, and managing through, a liquidity crisis and/or market dislocation. The contingency funding plan also describes in detail our potential responses if our assessments indicate that we have entered\\na liquidity crisis, which include pre-funding for what we estimate will be our potential cash and collateral needs, as well as utilizing secondary sources of liquidity. Mitigants and action items to address\\nspecific risks which may arise are also described and assigned to individuals responsible for execution. \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGoldman\\xa0Sachs\\xa02017\\xa0Form 10-K\\n\\xa0\\n83\\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Group Inc. also provided, directly or indirectly, $114.98\\xa0billion of unsubordinated loans (including secured loans of $50.59\\xa0billion), and $13.38\\xa0billion of collateral and cash deposits to these entities,\\nsubstantially all of which was to GS&Co., GSI, GSJCL and GS Bank USA, as of December\\xa02017. In addition, as of December\\xa02017, Group Inc. had significant amounts of capital invested in and loans to its other regulated subsidiaries. \\nContingency Funding Plan. We maintain a contingency\\nfunding plan to provide a framework for analyzing and responding to a liquidity crisis situation or periods of market stress. Our contingency funding plan outlines a list of potential risk factors, key reports and metrics that are reviewed on an\\nongoing basis to assist in assessing the severity of, and managing through, a liquidity crisis and/or market dislocation. The contingency funding plan also describes in detail our potential responses if our assessments indicate that we have entered\\na liquidity crisis, which include pre-funding for what we estimate will be our potential cash and collateral needs, as well as utilizing secondary sources of liquidity. Mitigants and action items to address\\nspecific risks which may arise are also described and assigned to individuals responsible for execution. Our intercompany funding policies assume that a subsidiary\\x92s funds or securities are not\\nfreely available to its parent, Funding IHC or other subsidiaries unless (i)\\xa0legally provided for and (ii)\\xa0there are no additional regulatory, tax or other restrictions. In particular, many of our subsidiaries are subject to laws that\\nauthorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to Group Inc. or Funding IHC. Regulatory action of that kind could impede access to funds that Group Inc. needs to make payments on its obligations.\\nAccordingly, we assume that the capital provided to our regulated subsidiaries is not available to Group Inc. or other subsidiaries and any other financing provided to our regulated subsidiaries is not available to Group Inc. or Funding IHC until\\nthe maturity of such financing. Group Inc. has provided substantial amounts of equity and subordinated indebtedness, directly or\\nindirectly, to its regulated subsidiaries.

The contingency funding plan also details the responsibilities of these groups and individuals, which include\\nmaking and disseminating key decisions, coordinating all contingency activities throughout the duration of the crisis or period of market stress, implementing liquidity maintenance activities and managing internal and external communication. \\nLiquidity Stress Tests  In order to determine the\\nappropriate size of our GCLA, we use an internal liquidity model, referred to as the Modeled Liquidity Outflow, which captures and quantifies our liquidity risks. We also consider other factors including, but not limited to, an assessment of our\\npotential intraday liquidity needs through an additional internal liquidity model, referred to as the Intraday Liquidity Model, the results of our long-term stress testing models, our resolution liquidity models and other applicable regulatory\\nrequirements and a qualitative assessment of our condition, as well as the financial markets. The results of the Modeled Liquidity Outflow, the Intraday Liquidity Model, the long-term stress testing models and the resolution liquidity models are\\nreported to senior management on a regular basis.  Modeled Liquidity Outflow. Our Modeled Liquidity Outflow is based on conducting multiple scenarios that include combinations of market-wide and firm-specific stress. These scenarios are characterized by the following qualitative\\nelements:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Severely challenged market environments, including low consumer and corporate confidence, financial and\\npolitical instability, adverse changes in market values, including potential declines in equity markets and widening of credit spreads; and  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n A firm-specific crisis potentially triggered by material losses, reputational damage, litigation, executive\\ndeparture, and/or a ratings downgrade.

The U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have not released the final rule. We expect that we will be compliant with the NSFR\\nrequirement by the effective date of the final rule. The following is information on our subsidiary liquidity regulatory requirements:\\n\\xa0GS Bank USA. GS Bank USA is subject to minimum liquidity\\nstandards under the LCR rule approved by the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies. As of December\\xa02017, GS Bank USA\\x92s LCR exceeded the minimum requirement.

We monitor the local regulatory liquidity\\nrequirements of our subsidiaries to ensure compliance. For many of our subsidiaries, these requirements either have changed or are likely to change in the future due to the implementation of the Basel Committee\\x92s framework for liquidity risk\\nmeasurement, standards and monitoring, as well as other regulatory developments.

Credit Ratings\\n We rely on the short-term and long-term debt capital markets to fund a significant portion of our day-to-day operations and the cost and availability of debt financing is influenced by our credit ratings.

AND SUBSIDIARIES \\nManagement\\x92s Discussion and Analysis  \\xa0\\nMarket Risk Management \\n\\xa0\\nOverview \\nMarket risk is the risk of loss in the value of our inventory, as well as certain other financial assets and financial liabilities, due to\\nchanges in market conditions. We employ a variety of risk measures, each described in the respective sections below, to monitor market risk.

AND SUBSIDIARIES \\nManagement\\x92s Discussion and Analysis  \\xa0\\n\\nWhen calculating VaR, we use historical simulations with full valuation of approximately 70,000\\nmarket factors. VaR is calculated at a position level based on simultaneously shocking the relevant market risk factors for that position. We sample from five years of historical data to generate the scenarios for our VaR calculation. The historical\\ndata is weighted so that the relative importance of the data reduces over time. This gives greater importance to more recent observations and reflects current asset volatilities, which improves the accuracy of our estimates of potential loss. As a\\nresult, even if our positions included in VaR were unchanged, our VaR would increase with increasing market volatility and vice versa. \\nGiven its reliance on historical data, VaR is most effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are no sudden fundamental\\nchanges or shifts in market conditions.  Our VaR measure does not include: \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Positions that are best measured and monitored using sensitivity measures; and \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n The impact of changes in counterparty and our own credit spreads on derivatives, as well as changes in our own\\ncredit spreads on financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected.  We perform daily backtesting of our\\nVaR model (i.e., comparing daily net revenues for positions included in VaR to the VaR measure calculated as of the prior business day) at the firmwide level and for each of our businesses and major regulated subsidiaries. \\nStress Testing. Stress testing is a method of\\ndetermining the effect of various hypothetical stress scenarios.\\xa0We use stress testing to examine risks of specific portfolios, as well as the potential impact of our significant risk exposures. We use a variety of stress testing techniques to\\ncalculate the potential loss from a wide range of market moves on our portfolios, including sensitivity analysis, scenario analysis and firmwide stress tests. The results of our various stress tests are analyzed together for risk management\\npurposes.  Sensitivity analysis is used to quantify the impact of a market move in a single risk factor across all positions (e.g.,\\nequity prices or credit spreads) using a variety of defined market shocks, ranging from those that could be expected over a one-day time horizon up to those that could take many months to occur. We also use\\nsensitivity analysis to quantify the impact of the default of any single entity, which captures the risk of large or concentrated exposures.\\n\\nScenario analysis is used to quantify the impact of a specified event, including how the event\\nimpacts multiple risk factors simultaneously. For example, for sovereign stress testing we calculate potential direct exposure associated with our sovereign inventory, as well as the corresponding debt, equity and currency exposures associated with\\nour non-sovereign inventory that may be impacted by the sovereign distress. When conducting scenario analysis, we typically consider a number of possible outcomes for each scenario, ranging from moderate to\\nseverely adverse market impacts. In addition, these stress tests are constructed using both historical events and forward-looking hypothetical scenarios. \\nFirmwide stress testing combines market, credit, operational and liquidity risks into a single combined scenario. Firmwide stress tests are\\nprimarily used to assess capital adequacy as part of our capital planning and stress testing process; however, firmwide stress testing is also integrated into our risk governance framework. This includes selecting appropriate scenarios to use for\\nour capital planning and stress testing process. See \\x93Equity Capital Management and Regulatory Capital\\xa0\\x97 Equity Capital Management\\x94 above for further information. \\nUnlike VaR measures, which have an implied probability because they are calculated at a specified confidence level, there is generally no\\nimplied probability that our stress test scenarios will occur. Instead, stress tests are used to model both moderate and more extreme moves in underlying market factors. When estimating potential loss, we generally assume that our positions cannot\\nbe reduced or hedged (although experience demonstrates that we are generally able to do so).  Stress test scenarios are conducted on a\\nregular basis as part of our routine risk management process and on an ad hoc basis in response to market events or concerns. Stress testing is an important part of our risk management process because it allows us to quantify our exposure to tail\\nrisks, highlight potential loss concentrations, undertake risk/reward analysis, and assess and mitigate our risk positions.  Limits. We use risk limits at various levels (including firmwide, business and product) to govern our risk appetite by controlling the size of our exposures to market\\nrisk. Limits are set based on VaR and on a range of stress tests relevant to our exposures. Limits are reviewed frequently and amended on a permanent or temporary basis to reflect changing market conditions, business conditions or tolerance for\\nrisk. \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n90\\n\\xa0\\nGoldman\\xa0Sachs\\xa02017\\xa0Form 10-K\\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

In addition, Market Risk Management (through\\ndelegated authority from the Risk Governance Committee) sets market risk limits and sub-limits at certain product and desk levels. \\nThe purpose of the firmwide limits is to assist senior management in controlling our overall risk profile.\\nSub-limits are set below the approved level of risk limits. Sub-limits set the desired maximum amount of exposure that may be managed by any particular business on a day-to-day basis without additional levels of senior management approval, effectively leaving\\nday-to-day decisions to individual desk managers and traders. Accordingly, sub-limits are a management tool designed to ensure\\nappropriate escalation rather than to establish maximum risk tolerance. Sub-limits also distribute risk among various businesses in a manner that is consistent with their level of activity and client demand,\\ntaking into account the relative performance of each area.  Our market risk limits are monitored daily by Market Risk Management, which is\\nresponsible for identifying and escalating, on a timely basis, instances where limits have been exceeded.  When a risk limit has been\\nexceeded (e.g., due to positional changes or changes in market conditions, such as increased volatilities or changes in correlations), it is escalated to senior managers in Market Risk Management and/or the appropriate risk committee. Such instances\\nare remediated by an inventory reduction and/or a temporary or permanent increase to the risk limit.  Model Review and Validation \\nOur VaR and stress testing models are regularly reviewed by Market Risk Management and enhanced in order to incorporate changes in the\\ncomposition of positions included in our market risk measures, as well as variations in market conditions.

VaR excludes the impact of changes in counterparty and our own credit spreads on derivatives, as well as changes in our own credit spreads (debt valuation adjustment) on financial\\nliabilities for which the fair value option was elected. The estimated sensitivity to a one basis point increase in credit spreads (counterparty and our own) on derivatives was a gain of $3\\xa0million and $2\\xa0million (including hedges) as of\\nDecember\\xa02017 and December\\xa02016, respectively.

However, the actual net impact of a change in our own credit spreads is also affected by the liquidity, duration and convexity (as the sensitivity\\nis not linear to changes in yields) of those financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected, as well as the relative performance of any hedges undertaken. \\nInterest Rate Sensitivity. Loans receivable as of\\nDecember\\xa02017 and December\\xa02016 were $65.93\\xa0billion and $49.67\\xa0billion, respectively, substantially all of which had floating interest rates. As of December\\xa02017 and December\\xa02016, the estimated sensitivity to a 100\\nbasis point increase in interest rates on such loans was $527\\xa0million and $405\\xa0million, respectively, of additional interest income over a twelve-month period, which does not take into account the potential impact of an increase in costs\\nto fund such loans. See Note\\xa09 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about loans receivable.  Other Market Risk\\nConsiderations  As of December\\xa02017 and December\\xa02016, we had commitments and held loans for which we have obtained credit\\nloss protection from Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Inc.

VaR excludes the impact of changes in counterparty and our own credit spreads on derivatives, as well as changes in our own credit spreads (debt valuation adjustment) on financial\\nliabilities for which the fair value option was elected. The estimated sensitivity to a one basis point increase in credit spreads (counterparty and our own) on derivatives was a gain of $3\\xa0million and $2\\xa0million (including hedges) as of\\nDecember\\xa02017 and December\\xa02016, respectively. In addition, the estimated sensitivity to a one basis point increase in our own credit spreads on financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected was a gain of\\n$35\\xa0million and $25\\xa0million as of December\\xa02017 and December\\xa02016, respectively. However, the actual net impact of a change in our own credit spreads is also affected by the liquidity, duration and convexity (as the sensitivity\\nis not linear to changes in yields) of those financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected, as well as the relative performance of any hedges undertaken. \\nInterest Rate Sensitivity. Loans receivable as of\\nDecember\\xa02017 and December\\xa02016 were $65.93\\xa0billion and $49.67\\xa0billion, respectively, substantially all of which had floating interest rates. As of December\\xa02017 and December\\xa02016, the estimated sensitivity to a 100\\nbasis point increase in interest rates on such loans was $527\\xa0million and $405\\xa0million, respectively, of additional interest income over a twelve-month period, which does not take into account the potential impact of an increase in costs\\nto fund such loans. See Note\\xa09 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about loans receivable.  Other Market Risk\\nConsiderations  As of December\\xa02017 and December\\xa02016, we had commitments and held loans for which we have obtained credit\\nloss protection from Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Inc.

Our exposure to credit risk comes mostly from client\\ntransactions in OTC derivatives and loans and lending commitments. Credit risk also comes from cash placed with banks, securities financing transactions (i.e., resale and repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and lending activities) and\\nreceivables from brokers, dealers, clearing organizations, customers and counterparties.\\n\\nCredit Risk Management, which is independent of the revenue-producing units and reports to our\\nchief risk officer, has primary responsibility for assessing, monitoring and managing credit risk. The Firmwide Risk Committee and the Risk Governance Committee establish and review credit policies and parameters. In addition, we hold other\\npositions that give rise to credit risk (e.g., bonds held in our inventory and secondary bank loans). These credit risks are captured as a component of market risk measures, which are monitored and managed by Market Risk Management, consistent with\\nother inventory positions. We also enter into derivatives to manage market risk exposures. Such derivatives also give rise to credit risk, which is monitored and managed by Credit Risk Management. \\nCredit Risk Management Process  Effective management\\nof credit risk requires accurate and timely information, a high level of communication and knowledge of customers, countries, industries and products. Our process for managing credit risk includes: \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Approving transactions and setting and communicating credit exposure limits; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Establishing or approving underwriting standards; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Monitoring compliance with established credit exposure limits; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Assessing the likelihood that a counterparty will default on its payment obligations; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Measuring our current and potential credit exposure and losses resulting from counterparty default;\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Reporting of credit exposures to senior management, the Board and regulators; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Using credit risk mitigants, including collateral and hedging; and \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Communicating and collaborating with other independent control and support functions such as operations, legal\\nand compliance.  As part of the risk assessment process, Credit Risk Management performs credit reviews, which include\\ninitial and ongoing analyses of our counterparties. For substantially all of our credit exposures, the core of our process is an annual counterparty credit review. A credit review is an independent analysis of the capacity and willingness of a\\ncounterparty to meet its financial obligations, resulting in an internal credit rating. The determination of internal credit ratings also incorporates assumptions with respect to the nature of and outlook for the counterparty\\x92s industry, and\\nthe economic environment.

AND SUBSIDIARIES \\nManagement\\x92s Discussion and Analysis  \\xa0\\n\\nOur risk assessment process may also include, where applicable, reviewing certain key metrics,\\nsuch as delinquency status, collateral values, FICO credit scores and other risk factors.  Our global credit risk management systems\\ncapture credit exposure to individual counterparties and on an aggregate basis to counterparties and their subsidiaries (economic groups). These systems also provide management with comprehensive information on our aggregate credit risk by product,\\ninternal credit rating, industry, country and region.  Risk Measures and Limits \\nWe measure our credit risk based on the potential loss in the event of non-payment by a counterparty\\nusing current and potential exposure. For derivatives and securities financing transactions, current exposure represents the amount presently owed to us after taking into account applicable netting and collateral arrangements, while potential\\nexposure represents our estimate of the future exposure that could arise over the life of a transaction based on market movements within a specified confidence level. Potential exposure also takes into account netting and collateral arrangements.\\nFor loans and lending commitments, the primary measure is a function of the notional amount of the position.  We use credit limits at\\nvarious levels (e.g., counterparty, economic group, industry and country), as well as underwriting standards to control the size and nature of our credit exposures. Limits for counterparties and economic groups are reviewed regularly and revised to\\nreflect changing risk appetites for a given counterparty or group of counterparties. Limits for industries and countries are based on our risk tolerance and are designed to allow for regular monitoring, review, escalation and management of credit\\nrisk concentrations.  The Risk Committee of the Board and the Risk Governance Committee (through delegated authority from the Firmwide Risk\\nCommittee) approve credit risk limits at firmwide, business and product levels, consistent with our risk appetite statement. Credit Risk Management (through delegated authority from the Risk Governance Committee) sets credit limits for individual\\ncounterparties, economic groups, industries and countries. Policies authorized by the Firmwide Risk Committee and the Risk Governance Committee prescribe the level of formal approval required for us to assume credit exposure to a counterparty across\\nall product areas, taking into account any applicable netting provisions, collateral or other credit risk mitigants.\\n\\nStress Tests \\nWe use regular stress tests to calculate the credit exposures, including potential concentrations that would result from applying shocks to\\ncounterparty credit ratings or credit risk factors (e.g., currency rates, interest rates, equity prices). These shocks include a wide range of moderate and more extreme market movements. Some of our stress tests include shocks to multiple risk\\nfactors, consistent with the occurrence of a severe market or economic event. In the case of sovereign default, we estimate the direct impact of the default on our sovereign credit exposures, changes to our credit exposures arising from potential\\nmarket moves in response to the default, and the impact of credit market deterioration on corporate borrowers and counterparties that may result from the sovereign default. Unlike potential exposure, which is calculated within a specified confidence\\nlevel, with a stress test there is generally no assumed probability of these events occurring.  We perform stress tests on a regular basis\\nas part of our routine risk management processes and conduct tailored stress tests on an ad hoc basis in response to market developments. Stress tests are conducted jointly with our market and liquidity risk functions. \\nModel Review and Validation  Our potential credit\\nexposure and stress testing models, and any changes to such models or assumptions, are reviewed by Model Risk Management. See \\x93Model Risk Management\\x94 for further information about the review and validation of these models. \\nRisk Mitigants  To reduce our credit exposures on\\nderivatives and securities financing transactions, we may enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit us to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties. We may also reduce credit risk with counterparties by entering\\ninto agreements that enable us to obtain collateral from them on an upfront or contingent basis and/or to terminate transactions if the counterparty\\x92s credit rating falls below a specified level. We monitor the fair value of the collateral on a\\ndaily basis to ensure that our credit exposures are appropriately collateralized. We seek to minimize exposures where there is a significant positive correlation between the creditworthiness of our counterparties and the market value of collateral\\nwe receive. \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGoldman\\xa0Sachs\\xa02017\\xa0Form 10-K\\n\\xa0\\n95\\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

See \\x93Model Risk Management\\x94 for further information about the review and validation of these models. \\nRisk Mitigants  To reduce our credit exposures on\\nderivatives and securities financing transactions, we may enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit us to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties. We may also reduce credit risk with counterparties by entering\\ninto agreements that enable us to obtain collateral from them on an upfront or contingent basis and/or to terminate transactions if the counterparty\\x92s credit rating falls below a specified level. We monitor the fair value of the collateral on a\\ndaily basis to ensure that our credit exposures are appropriately collateralized. We seek to minimize exposures where there is a significant positive correlation between the creditworthiness of our counterparties and the market value of collateral\\nwe receive. Stress Tests We use regular stress tests to calculate the credit exposures, including potential concentrations that would result from applying shocks to\\ncounterparty credit ratings or credit risk factors (e.g., currency rates, interest rates, equity prices). These shocks include a wide range of moderate and more extreme market movements. Some of our stress tests include shocks to multiple risk\\nfactors, consistent with the occurrence of a severe market or economic event. In the case of sovereign default, we estimate the direct impact of the default on our sovereign credit exposures, changes to our credit exposures arising from potential\\nmarket moves in response to the default, and the impact of credit market deterioration on corporate borrowers and counterparties that may result from the sovereign default. Unlike potential exposure, which is calculated within a specified confidence\\nlevel, with a stress test there is generally no assumed probability of these events occurring. We perform stress tests on a regular basis\\nas part of our routine risk management processes and conduct tailored stress tests on an ad hoc basis in response to market developments. Stress tests are conducted jointly with our market and liquidity risk functions.

We generally enter into OTC derivatives transactions under bilateral collateral arrangements that require the daily exchange of\\ncollateral. As credit risk is an essential component of fair value, we include a credit valuation adjustment (CVA) in the fair value of derivatives to reflect counterparty credit risk, as described in Note\\xa07 to the consolidated financial\\nstatements.

We are exposed to credit risk from our receivables from brokers, dealers and clearing organizations and customers and counterparties. Receivables from brokers, dealers and clearing organizations primarily consist\\nof initial margin placed with clearing organizations and receivables related to sales of securities which have traded, but not yet settled. These receivables generally have minimal credit risk due to the low probability of clearing organization\\ndefault and the short-term nature of receivables related to securities settlements. Receivables from customers and counterparties generally consist of collateralized receivables related to customer securities transactions and generally have minimal\\ncredit risk due to both the value of the collateral received and the short-term nature of these receivables. Our net credit exposure related to these activities was $34.32\\xa0billion and $31.39\\xa0billion as of December\\xa02017 and\\nDecember\\xa02016, respectively, and primarily consisted of initial margin (both cash and securities) placed with investment-grade clearing organizations.

Credit exposure represents the potential for loss due to the default or deterioration in credit quality of a counterparty or borrower.\\nMarket exposure represents the potential for loss in value of our long and short inventory due to changes in market prices.  The debt\\ncrisis in Mozambique has resulted in credit rating downgrades and Venezuela has delayed payments on its sovereign debt. Our total credit and market exposure to each of Mozambique and Venezuela as of December\\xa02017 was not material. \\nWe have a comprehensive framework to monitor, measure and assess our country exposures and to determine our risk appetite. We determine the\\ncountry of risk by the location of the counterparty, issuer or underlier\\x92s assets, where they generate revenue, the country in which they are headquartered, the jurisdiction where a claim against them could be enforced, and/or the government\\nwhose policies affect their ability to repay their obligations. We monitor our credit exposure to a specific country both at the individual counterparty level, as well as at the aggregate country level.\\n\\nWe use regular stress tests, described above, to calculate the credit exposures, including\\npotential concentrations that would result from applying shocks to counterparty credit ratings or credit risk factors. To supplement these regular stress tests, we also conduct tailored stress tests on an ad hoc basis in response to specific market\\nevents that we deem significant. These stress tests are designed to estimate the direct impact of the event on our credit and market exposures resulting from shocks to risk factors including, but not limited to, currency rates, interest rates, and\\nequity prices. We also utilize these stress tests to estimate the indirect impact of certain hypothetical events on our country exposures, such as the impact of credit market deterioration on corporate borrowers and counterparties along with the\\nshocks to the risk factors described above. The parameters of these shocks vary based on the scenario reflected in each stress test. We review estimated losses produced by the stress tests in order to understand their magnitude, highlight potential\\nloss concentrations, and assess and mitigate our exposures where necessary.

We monitor our credit exposure to a specific country both at the individual counterparty level, as well as at the aggregate country level.\\n\\nWe use regular stress tests, described above, to calculate the credit exposures, including\\npotential concentrations that would result from applying shocks to counterparty credit ratings or credit risk factors. To supplement these regular stress tests, we also conduct tailored stress tests on an ad hoc basis in response to specific market\\nevents that we deem significant. These stress tests are designed to estimate the direct impact of the event on our credit and market exposures resulting from shocks to risk factors including, but not limited to, currency rates, interest rates, and\\nequity prices. We also utilize these stress tests to estimate the indirect impact of certain hypothetical events on our country exposures, such as the impact of credit market deterioration on corporate borrowers and counterparties along with the\\nshocks to the risk factors described above. The parameters of these shocks vary based on the scenario reflected in each stress test. We review estimated losses produced by the stress tests in order to understand their magnitude, highlight potential\\nloss concentrations, and assess and mitigate our exposures where necessary.

The firm determines whether it has a controlling\\nfinancial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity (VIE).  Voting Interest Entities. Voting interest entities are entities in which (i)\\xa0the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable the entity to finance its\\nactivities independently and (ii)\\xa0the equity holders have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact its economic performance, the obligation to absorb the losses of the entity and the right to receive the\\nresidual returns of the entity. The usual condition for a controlling financial interest in a voting interest entity is ownership of a majority voting interest. If the firm has a controlling majority voting interest in a voting interest entity, the\\nentity is consolidated.  Variable Interest Entities. A VIE is an entity that lacks one or more of the characteristics of a voting interest entity. The firm has a controlling financial interest in a VIE when the firm has a variable interest or interests that provide\\nit with (i)\\xa0the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE\\x92s economic performance and (ii)\\xa0the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could\\npotentially be significant to the VIE. See Note\\xa012 for further information about VIEs. \\nEquity-Method Investments. When the firm does not have\\na controlling financial interest in an entity but can exert significant influence over the entity\\x92s operating and financial policies, the investment is accounted for either (i)\\xa0under the equity method of accounting or (ii)\\xa0at fair\\nvalue by electing the fair value option available under U.S. GAAP. Significant influence generally exists when the firm owns 20% to 50% of the entity\\x92s common stock or in-substance common stock.\\n In general, the firm accounts for investments acquired after the fair value option became available, at fair value. In certain\\ncases, the firm applies the equity method of accounting to new investments that are strategic in nature or closely related to the firm\\x92s principal business activities, when the firm has a significant degree of involvement in the cash flows or\\noperations of the investee or when cost-benefit considerations are less significant.

AND SUBSIDIARIES \\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \\xa0\\n\\nInvestment Funds. The firm has formed numerous investment funds with third-party investors. These funds are typically organized as limited partnerships or limited liability companies for which the firm acts as general partner or\\nmanager. Generally, the firm does not hold a majority of the economic interests in these funds. These funds are usually voting interest entities and generally are not consolidated because third-party investors typically have rights to terminate the\\nfunds or to remove the firm as general partner or manager. Investments in these funds are generally measured at net asset value (NAV) and are included in financial instruments owned. See Notes\\xa06, 18 and 22 for further information about\\ninvestments in funds.  Use of Estimates \\nPreparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions, the most important of\\nwhich relate to fair value measurements, accounting for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, income tax expense related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Legislation), provisions for losses that may arise from litigation and regulatory\\nproceedings (including governmental investigations), the allowance for losses on loans receivable and lending commitments held for investment, and provisions for losses that may arise from tax audits. These estimates and assumptions are based on the\\nbest available information but actual results could be materially different.

Financial instruments owned and financial instruments sold, but not yet purchased are recorded at fair value either under the fair value option or in accordance with other U.S. GAAP. In\\naddition, the firm has elected to account for certain of its other financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value by electing the fair value option. The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an\\nasset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Financial assets are marked to bid prices and financial liabilities are marked to offer prices. Fair value measurements do not\\ninclude transaction costs. Fair value gains or losses are generally included in market making for positions in Institutional Client Services and other principal transactions for positions in Investing\\xa0& Lending. See Notes\\xa05 through 8\\nfor further information about fair value measurements.\\n\\nInvestment Banking. Fees from financial advisory assignments and underwriting revenues are recognized in earnings when the services related to the underlying transaction are completed under the terms of the assignment. Expenses\\nassociated with such transactions are deferred until the related revenue is recognized or the assignment is otherwise concluded. Expenses associated with financial advisory assignments are recorded as\\nnon-compensation expenses, net of client reimbursements. Underwriting revenues are presented net of related expenses. As a result of adopting ASU No.\\xa02014-09,\\n\\x93Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic\\xa0606),\\x94 the firm will amend its accounting policy on the recognition and presentation of certain investment banking revenues and related expenses. See \\x93Recent Accounting\\nDevelopments\\x94 for further information.  Investment Management. The firm earns management fees and incentive fees for investment management services. Management fees for mutual funds are calculated as a percentage of daily net asset value and are received monthly. Management\\nfees for hedge funds and separately managed accounts are calculated as a percentage of month-end net asset value and are generally received quarterly. Management fees for private equity funds are calculated as\\na percentage of monthly invested capital or commitments and are received quarterly, semi-annually or annually, depending on the fund. All management fees are recognized over the period that the related service is provided. Incentive fees are\\ncalculated as a percentage of a fund\\x92s or separately managed account\\x92s return, or excess return above a specified benchmark or other performance target. Incentive fees are generally based on investment performance over a 12-month period or over the life of a fund. Fees that are based on performance over a 12-month period are subject to adjustment prior to the end of the measurement period. For\\nfees that are based on investment performance over the life of the fund, future investment underperformance may require fees previously distributed to the firm to be returned to the fund. Incentive fees are recognized only when all material\\ncontingencies have been resolved. Management and incentive fee revenues are included in investment management revenues.  The firm\\nmakes payments to brokers and advisors related to the placement of the firm\\x92s investment funds. These payments are calculated based on either a percentage of the management fee or the investment fund\\x92s net asset value. Where the firm is\\nprincipal to the arrangement, such costs are recorded on a gross basis and included in brokerage, clearing, exchange and distribution fees, and where the firm is agent to the arrangement, such costs are recorded on a net basis in investment\\nmanagement revenues. \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGoldman\\xa0Sachs\\xa02017\\xa0Form 10-K\\n\\xa0\\n111\\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Interest on payables to customers and counterparties is recognized over the life of the transaction and included in\\ninterest expense.  Offsetting Assets and Liabilities \\nTo reduce credit exposures on derivatives and securities financing transactions, the firm may enter into master netting agreements or similar\\narrangements (collectively, netting agreements) with counterparties that permit it to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties. A netting agreement is a contract with a counterparty that permits net settlement of multiple\\ntransactions with that counterparty, including upon the exercise of termination rights by a non-defaulting party. Upon exercise of such termination rights, all transactions governed by the netting agreement\\nare terminated and a net settlement amount is calculated. In addition, the firm receives and posts cash and securities collateral with respect to its derivatives and securities financing transactions, subject to the terms of the related credit\\nsupport agreements or similar arrangements (collectively, credit support agreements). An enforceable credit support agreement grants the non-defaulting party exercising termination rights the right to\\nliquidate the collateral and apply the proceeds to any amounts owed. In order to assess enforceability of the firm\\x92s right of setoff under netting and credit support agreements, the firm evaluates various factors including applicable bankruptcy\\nlaws, local statutes and regulatory provisions in the jurisdiction of the parties to the agreement.  Derivatives are reported on a net-by-counterparty basis (i.e., the net payable or receivable for derivative assets and liabilities for a given counterparty) in the consolidated statements of financial\\ncondition when a legal right of setoff exists under an enforceable netting agreement. Resale and repurchase agreements and securities borrowed and loaned transactions with the same term and currency are presented on a\\nnet-by-counterparty basis in the consolidated statements of financial condition when such transactions meet certain settlement criteria and are subject to netting\\nagreements. \\nIn the consolidated statements of financial condition, derivatives are reported net of cash\\ncollateral received and posted under enforceable credit support agreements, when transacted under an enforceable netting agreement.\\xa0In the consolidated statements of financial condition, resale and repurchase agreements, and securities borrowed\\nand loaned, are not reported net of the related cash and securities received or posted as collateral. See Note\\xa010 for further information about collateral received and pledged, including rights to deliver or repledge collateral. See\\nNotes\\xa07 and 10 for further information about offsetting.  Foreign Currency Translation \\nAssets and liabilities denominated in non-U.S. currencies are translated at rates of exchange\\nprevailing on the date of the consolidated statements of financial condition and revenues and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange for the period. Foreign currency remeasurement gains or losses on transactions in nonfunctional\\ncurrencies are recognized in earnings. Gains or losses on translation of the financial statements of a non-U.S. operation, when the functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar, are included, net of\\nhedges and taxes, in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.  Recent Accounting Developments \\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC\\xa0606).\\nIn May\\xa02014, the FASB issued ASU No.\\xa02014-09. This ASU, as amended, provides comprehensive guidance on the recognition of revenue from customers arising from the transfer of goods and services,\\nguidance on accounting for certain contract costs and new disclosures.  The firm adopted this ASU in January\\xa02018 under a\\nmodified retrospective approach. As a result of adopting this ASU, the firm will, among other things, delay recognition of non-refundable and milestone payments on financial advisory assignments until the\\nassignments are completed, and recognize certain investment management fees earlier than under the firm\\x92s existing revenue recognition policies. The cumulative effect of adopting this ASU on January\\xa01,\\xa02018 was a decrease to retained\\nearnings of $53\\xa0million (net of tax). \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGoldman\\xa0Sachs\\xa02017\\xa0Form 10-K\\n\\xa0\\n113\\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Offsetting Assets and Liabilities \\nTo reduce credit exposures on derivatives and securities financing transactions, the firm may enter into master netting agreements or similar\\narrangements (collectively, netting agreements) with counterparties that permit it to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties. A netting agreement is a contract with a counterparty that permits net settlement of multiple\\ntransactions with that counterparty, including upon the exercise of termination rights by a non-defaulting party. Upon exercise of such termination rights, all transactions governed by the netting agreement\\nare terminated and a net settlement amount is calculated. In addition, the firm receives and posts cash and securities collateral with respect to its derivatives and securities financing transactions, subject to the terms of the related credit\\nsupport agreements or similar arrangements (collectively, credit support agreements). An enforceable credit support agreement grants the non-defaulting party exercising termination rights the right to\\nliquidate the collateral and apply the proceeds to any amounts owed. In order to assess enforceability of the firm\\x92s right of setoff under netting and credit support agreements, the firm evaluates various factors including applicable bankruptcy\\nlaws, local statutes and regulatory provisions in the jurisdiction of the parties to the agreement.  Derivatives are reported on a net-by-counterparty basis (i.e., the net payable or receivable for derivative assets and liabilities for a given counterparty) in the consolidated statements of financial\\ncondition when a legal right of setoff exists under an enforceable netting agreement. Resale and repurchase agreements and securities borrowed and loaned transactions with the same term and currency are presented on a\\nnet-by-counterparty basis in the consolidated statements of financial condition when such transactions meet certain settlement criteria and are subject to netting\\nagreements. Payables to Customers and Counterparties Payables to customers and counterparties primarily consist of customer credit balances related to the firm\\x92s prime brokerage activities.\\nPayables to customers and counterparties are accounted for at cost plus accrued interest, which generally approximates fair value. While these payables are carried at amounts that approximate fair value, they are not accounted for at fair value\\nunder the fair value option or at fair value in accordance with other U.S. GAAP and therefore are not included in the firm\\x92s fair value hierarchy in Notes\\xa06 through 8.

This change has no impact on total shareholders\\x92 equity and is required to be adopted prospectively. The ASU also allows for\\nforfeitures to be recorded when they occur rather than estimated over the vesting period. This change is required to be applied on a modified retrospective basis. The firm adopted the ASU in January\\xa02017 and the impact of the restricted stock unit (RSU) deliveries and option exercises during 2017 was\\na reduction to the provision for taxes of $719\\xa0million, which was recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings.

AND SUBSIDIARIES \\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \\xa0\\nNote\\xa05. \\nFair Value Measurements \\n\\xa0\\nThe fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset\\nor paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Financial assets are marked to bid prices and financial liabilities are marked to offer prices. Fair value measurements do not include\\ntransaction costs. The firm measures certain financial assets and financial liabilities as a portfolio (i.e., based on its net exposure to market and/or credit risks). \\nThe best evidence of fair value is a quoted price in an active market. If quoted prices in active markets are not available, fair value is\\ndetermined by reference to prices for similar instruments, quoted prices or recent transactions in less active markets, or internally developed models that primarily use market-based or independently sourced inputs including, but not limited to,\\ninterest rates, volatilities, equity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, credit spreads and funding spreads (i.e., the spread or difference between the interest rate at which a borrower could finance a given financial\\ninstrument relative to a benchmark interest rate).  U.S. GAAP has a three-level hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements. This\\nhierarchy prioritizes inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value, giving the highest priority to level\\xa01 inputs and the lowest priority to level\\xa03 inputs. A financial instrument\\x92s level in this hierarchy is based on\\nthe lowest level of input that is significant to its fair value measurement. In evaluating the significance of a valuation input, the firm considers, among other factors, a portfolio\\x92s net risk exposure to that input. The fair value hierarchy\\nis as follows:  Level\\xa01. Inputs are unadjusted\\nquoted prices in active markets to which the firm had access at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities. \\nLevel\\xa02. Inputs to valuation techniques are\\nobservable, either directly or indirectly.  Level\\xa03. One or more inputs to valuation techniques are significant and unobservable.\\n\\nThe fair values for substantially all of the firm\\x92s financial assets and financial\\nliabilities are based on observable prices and inputs and are classified in levels\\xa01 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Certain level\\xa02 and level\\xa03 financial assets and financial liabilities may require appropriate valuation\\nadjustments that a market participant would require to arrive at fair value for factors such as counterparty and the firm\\x92s credit quality, funding risk, transfer restrictions, liquidity and bid/offer spreads. Valuation adjustments are\\ngenerally based on market evidence.  See Notes\\xa06 through 8 for further information about fair value measurements of cash instruments,\\nderivatives and other financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value.

Fair Value Measurements \\xa0\\nThe fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset\\nor paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Financial assets are marked to bid prices and financial liabilities are marked to offer prices. Fair value measurements do not include\\ntransaction costs. The firm measures certain financial assets and financial liabilities as a portfolio (i.e., based on its net exposure to market and/or credit risks). \\nThe best evidence of fair value is a quoted price in an active market. If quoted prices in active markets are not available, fair value is\\ndetermined by reference to prices for similar instruments, quoted prices or recent transactions in less active markets, or internally developed models that primarily use market-based or independently sourced inputs including, but not limited to,\\ninterest rates, volatilities, equity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, credit spreads and funding spreads (i.e., the spread or difference between the interest rate at which a borrower could finance a given financial\\ninstrument relative to a benchmark interest rate).

Significant inputs include:\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Market yields implied by transactions of similar or related assets and/or current levels and trends of market\\nindices such as CDX and LCDX (indices that track the performance of corporate credit and loans, respectively);\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Current performance and recovery assumptions and, where the firm uses credit default swaps to value the\\nrelated cash instrument, the cost of borrowing the underlying reference obligation; and  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Duration. \\nEquity Securities. Equity securities includes private\\nequity securities and convertible debentures. Recent third-party completed or pending transactions (e.g., merger proposals, tender offers, debt restructurings) are considered to be the best evidence for any change in fair value. When these are not\\navailable, the following valuation methodologies are used, as appropriate:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Industry multiples (primarily EBITDA multiples) and public comparables; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Transactions in similar instruments; \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Discounted cash flow techniques; and \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Third-party appraisals. \\nThe firm also considers changes in the outlook for the relevant industry and financial performance of the issuer as compared to projected\\nperformance.

The net realized and\\nunrealized gains on level\\xa03 cash instrument assets of $1.56\\xa0billion (reflecting $419\\xa0million of net realized gains and $1.14\\xa0billion of net unrealized gains) for 2017 included gains/(losses) of approximately $(99)\\xa0million,\\n$1.13\\xa0billion and $532\\xa0million reported in market making, other principal transactions and interest income, respectively. \\nThe net unrealized gains on level\\xa03 cash instrument assets for 2017 primarily reflected gains on private equity securities, principally\\ndriven by strong corporate performance and company-specific events.

These derivatives are used to manage interest rate exposure in certain fixed-rate unsecured long-term and short-term borrowings, and deposits, and to manage foreign currency exposure\\non the net investment in certain non-U.S. operations. The firm enters into various types of\\nderivatives, including: \\xa0Futures and Forwards. Contracts that commit counterparties to\\npurchase or sell financial instruments, commodities or currencies in the future. \\xa0Swaps. Contracts that require counterparties to exchange cash\\nflows such as currency or interest payment streams. The amounts exchanged are based on the specific terms of the contract with reference to specified rates, financial instruments, commodities, currencies or indices. \\xa0Options. Contracts in which the option purchaser has the right,\\nbut not the obligation, to purchase from or sell to the option writer financial instruments, commodities or currencies within a defined time period for a specified price. Derivatives are reported on a net-by-counterparty basis (i.e.,\\nthe net payable or receivable for derivative assets and liabilities for a given counterparty) when a legal right of setoff exists under an enforceable netting agreement (counterparty netting). Derivatives are accounted for at fair value, net of cash\\ncollateral received or posted under enforceable credit support agreements (cash collateral netting). Derivative assets and liabilities are included in financial instruments owned and financial instruments sold, but not yet purchased, respectively.\\nRealized and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives not designated as hedges under ASC\\xa0815 are included in market making and other principal transactions in Note\\xa04.\\n\\nThe tables below present the gross fair value and the notional amounts of derivative contracts\\nby major product type, the amounts of counterparty and cash collateral netting in the consolidated statements of financial condition, as well as cash and securities collateral posted and received under enforceable credit support agreements that do\\nnot meet the criteria for netting under U.S. GAAP.

AND SUBSIDIARIES \\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Currency. Prices for currency derivatives based on the exchange\\nrates of leading industrialized nations, including those with longer tenors, are generally transparent. The primary difference between the price transparency of developed and emerging market currency derivatives is that emerging markets tend to be\\nobservable for contracts with shorter tenors.  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Commodity. Commodity derivatives include transactions referenced\\nto energy (e.g., oil and natural gas), metals (e.g., precious and base) and soft commodities (e.g., agricultural). Price transparency varies based on the underlying commodity, delivery location, tenor and product quality (e.g., diesel fuel compared\\nto unleaded gasoline). In general, price transparency for commodity derivatives is greater for contracts with shorter tenors and contracts that are more closely aligned with major and/or benchmark commodity indices. \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Equity. Price transparency for equity derivatives varies by\\nmarket and underlier. Options on indices and the common stock of corporates included in major equity indices exhibit the most price transparency. Equity derivatives generally have observable market prices, except for contracts with long tenors or\\nreference prices that differ significantly from current market prices. More complex equity derivatives, such as those sensitive to the correlation between two or more individual stocks, generally have less price transparency. \\nLiquidity is essential to observability of all product types. If transaction volumes decline, previously transparent prices and other inputs\\nmay become unobservable. Conversely, even highly structured products may at times have trading volumes large enough to provide observability of prices and other inputs. See Note\\xa05 for an overview of the firm\\x92s fair value measurement\\npolicies.  Level\\xa01 Derivatives \\nLevel\\xa01 derivatives include short-term contracts for future delivery of securities when the underlying security is a level\\xa01\\ninstrument, and exchange-traded derivatives if they are actively traded and are valued at their quoted market price.  Level\\xa02 Derivatives \\nLevel\\xa02 derivatives include OTC derivatives for which all significant valuation inputs are corroborated by market evidence and\\nexchange-traded derivatives that are not actively traded and/or that are valued using models that calibrate to market-clearing levels of OTC derivatives.\\n\\nThe selection of a particular model to value a derivative depends on the contractual terms of\\nand specific risks inherent in the instrument, as well as the availability of pricing information in the market. For derivatives that trade in liquid markets, model selection does not involve significant management judgment because outputs of models\\ncan be calibrated to market-clearing levels.  Valuation models require a variety of inputs, such as contractual terms, market prices, yield\\ncurves, discount rates (including those derived from interest rates on collateral received and posted as specified in credit support agreements for collateralized derivatives), credit curves, measures of volatility, prepayment rates, loss severity\\nrates and correlations of such inputs. Significant inputs to the valuations of level\\xa02 derivatives can be verified to market transactions, broker or dealer quotations or other alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price\\ntransparency. Consideration is given to the nature of the quotations (e.g., indicative or firm) and the relationship of recent market activity to the prices provided from alternative pricing sources. \\nLevel\\xa03 Derivatives  Level\\xa03 derivatives\\nare valued using models which utilize observable level\\xa01 and/or level\\xa02 inputs, as well as unobservable level\\xa03 inputs. The significant unobservable inputs used to value the firm\\x92s level\\xa03 derivatives are described below.\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n For the majority of the firm\\x92s interest rate and currency derivatives classified in level\\xa03,\\nsignificant unobservable inputs include correlations of certain currencies and interest rates (e.g., the correlation between Euro inflation and Euro interest rates) and specific interest rate volatilities. \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n For level\\xa03 credit derivatives, significant unobservable inputs include illiquid credit spreads and\\nupfront credit points, which are unique to specific reference obligations and reference entities, recovery rates and certain correlations required to value credit derivatives (e.g., the likelihood of default of the underlying reference obligation\\nrelative to one another).  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n For level\\xa03 commodity derivatives, significant unobservable inputs include volatilities for options with\\nstrike prices that differ significantly from current market prices and prices or spreads for certain products for which the product quality or physical location of the commodity is not aligned with benchmark indices.\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n128\\n\\xa0\\nGoldman\\xa0Sachs\\xa02017\\xa0Form 10-K\\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Price transparency for equity derivatives varies by\\nmarket and underlier. Options on indices and the common stock of corporates included in major equity indices exhibit the most price transparency. Equity derivatives generally have observable market prices, except for contracts with long tenors or\\nreference prices that differ significantly from current market prices. More complex equity derivatives, such as those sensitive to the correlation between two or more individual stocks, generally have less price transparency. \\nLiquidity is essential to observability of all product types. If transaction volumes decline, previously transparent prices and other inputs\\nmay become unobservable. Conversely, even highly structured products may at times have trading volumes large enough to provide observability of prices and other inputs. See Note\\xa05 for an overview of the firm\\x92s fair value measurement\\npolicies.  Level\\xa01 Derivatives \\nLevel\\xa01 derivatives include short-term contracts for future delivery of securities when the underlying security is a level\\xa01\\ninstrument, and exchange-traded derivatives if they are actively traded and are valued at their quoted market price.  Level\\xa02 Derivatives \\nLevel\\xa02 derivatives include OTC derivatives for which all significant valuation inputs are corroborated by market evidence and\\nexchange-traded derivatives that are not actively traded and/or that are valued using models that calibrate to market-clearing levels of OTC derivatives.\\nCurrency. Prices for currency derivatives based on the exchange\\nrates of leading industrialized nations, including those with longer tenors, are generally transparent. The primary difference between the price transparency of developed and emerging market currency derivatives is that emerging markets tend to be\\nobservable for contracts with shorter tenors. \\xa0Commodity. Commodity derivatives include transactions referenced\\nto energy (e.g., oil and natural gas), metals (e.g., precious and base) and soft commodities (e.g., agricultural). Price transparency varies based on the underlying commodity, delivery location, tenor and product quality (e.g., diesel fuel compared\\nto unleaded gasoline). In general, price transparency for commodity derivatives is greater for contracts with shorter tenors and contracts that are more closely aligned with major and/or benchmark commodity indices. \\xa0Equity.

Market-based inputs are generally used when calibrating valuation adjustments to market-clearing levels. In addition, for derivatives that include significant unobservable inputs, the firm makes model or exit price adjustments to account for the\\nvaluation uncertainty present in the transaction. \\nFair

An average greater than the median indicates that the majority of inputs are below the average. For example, the difference between the average and the median for credit spreads and oil spread inputs\\nindicates that the majority of the inputs fall in the lower end of the range.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n The ranges, averages and medians of these inputs are not representative of the appropriate inputs to use when\\ncalculating the fair value of any one derivative. For example, the highest correlation for interest rate derivatives is appropriate for valuing a specific interest rate derivative but may not be appropriate for valuing any other interest rate\\nderivative. Accordingly, the ranges of inputs do not represent uncertainty in, or possible ranges of, fair value measurements of the firm\\x92s level\\xa03 derivatives. \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Interest rates, currencies and equities derivatives are valued using option pricing models, credit derivatives\\nare valued using option pricing, correlation and discounted cash flow models, and commodities derivatives are valued using option pricing and discounted cash flow models. \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n The fair value of any one instrument may be determined using multiple valuation techniques. For example,\\noption pricing models and discounted cash flows models are typically used together to determine fair value. Therefore, the level\\xa03 balance encompasses both of these techniques. \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Correlation within currencies and equities includes cross-product type correlation. \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Natural gas spread represents the spread per\\xa0million British thermal units of natural gas.\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Oil spread represents the spread per barrel of oil and refined products. \\nRange of Significant Unobservable Inputs  The\\nfollowing is information about the ranges of significant unobservable inputs used to value the firm\\x92s level\\xa03 derivative instruments:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Correlation.\\xa0Ranges for correlation cover a variety of\\nunderliers both within one product type (e.g., equity index and equity single stock names) and across product types (e.g., correlation of an interest rate and a currency), as well as across regions. Generally, cross-product type correlation inputs\\nare used to value more complex instruments and are lower than correlation inputs on assets within the same derivative product type. \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Volatility.\\xa0Ranges for volatility cover numerous underliers\\nacross a variety of markets, maturities and strike prices. For example, volatility of equity indices is generally lower than volatility of single stocks. \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Credit spreads, upfront credit points and recovery rates. The\\nranges for credit spreads, upfront credit points and recovery rates cover a variety of underliers (index and single names), regions, sectors, maturities and credit qualities (high-yield and investment-grade).

\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Tenor is based on expected duration for mortgage-related credit derivatives and generally on remaining\\ncontractual maturity for other derivatives.  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Counterparty netting within the same product type and tenor category is included within such product type and\\ntenor category.  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Counterparty netting across product types within the same tenor category is included in counterparty netting\\nin tenors. Where the counterparty netting is across tenor categories, the netting is included in cross-tenor counterparty netting.  Credit\\nDerivatives  The firm enters into a broad array of credit derivatives in locations around the world to facilitate client transactions\\nand to manage the credit risk associated with market-making and investing and lending activities. Credit derivatives are actively managed based on the firm\\x92s net risk position. \\nCredit derivatives are generally individually negotiated contracts and can have various settlement and payment conventions. Credit events\\ninclude failure to pay, bankruptcy, acceleration of indebtedness, restructuring, repudiation and dissolution of the reference entity.  The\\nfirm enters into the following types of credit derivatives:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Credit Default Swaps. Single-name credit default swaps protect\\nthe buyer against the loss of principal on one or more bonds, loans or mortgages (reference obligations) in the event the issuer (reference entity) of the reference obligations suffers a credit event. The buyer of protection pays an initial or\\nperiodic premium to the seller and receives protection for the period of the contract. If there is no credit event, as defined in the contract, the seller of protection makes no payments to the buyer of protection. However, if a credit event occurs,\\nthe seller of protection is required to make a payment to the buyer of protection, which is calculated in accordance with the terms of the contract.  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Credit Options. In a credit option, the option writer assumes\\nthe obligation to purchase or sell a reference obligation at a specified price or credit spread. The option purchaser buys the right, but does not assume the obligation, to sell the reference obligation to, or purchase it from, the option writer.\\nThe payments on credit options depend either on a particular credit spread or the price of the reference obligation.\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGoldman\\xa0Sachs\\xa02017\\xa0Form 10-K\\n\\xa0\\n133\\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Credit derivatives may\\nreference a basket of single-name credit default swaps or a broad-based index. If a credit event occurs in one of the underlying reference obligations, the protection seller pays the protection buyer. The payment is typically a pro-rata portion of the transaction\\x92s total notional amount based on the underlying defaulted reference obligation. In certain transactions, the credit risk of a basket or index is separated into various\\nportions (tranches), each having different levels of subordination. The most junior tranches cover initial defaults and once losses exceed the notional amount of these junior tranches, any excess loss is covered by the next most senior tranche in\\nthe capital structure.  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Total Return Swaps. A total return swap transfers the risks\\nrelating to economic performance of a reference obligation from the protection buyer to the protection seller. Typically, the protection buyer receives from the protection seller a floating rate of interest and protection against any reduction in\\nfair value of the reference obligation, and in return the protection seller receives the cash flows associated with the reference obligation, plus any increase in the fair value of the reference obligation. \\nThe firm economically hedges its exposure to written credit derivatives primarily by entering into offsetting purchased credit derivatives with\\nidentical underliers. Substantially all of the firm\\x92s purchased credit derivative transactions are with financial institutions and are subject to stringent collateral thresholds. In addition, upon the occurrence of a specified trigger event,\\nthe firm may take possession of the reference obligations underlying a particular written credit derivative, and consequently may, upon liquidation of the reference obligations, recover amounts on the underlying reference obligations in the event of\\ndefault.  As of December\\xa02017, written and purchased credit derivatives had total gross notional amounts of $611.04\\xa0billion and\\n$643.37\\xa0billion, respectively, for total net notional purchased protection of $32.33\\xa0billion.

See below for information about the significant inputs used to value other financial\\nassets and financial liabilities at fair value, including the ranges of significant unobservable inputs used to value the level\\xa03 instruments within these categories. These ranges represent the significant unobservable inputs that were used in\\nthe valuation of each type of other financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value. The ranges and weighted averages of these inputs are not representative of the appropriate inputs to use when calculating the fair value of any one\\ninstrument. For example, the highest yield presented below for other secured financings is appropriate for valuing a specific agreement in that category but may not be appropriate for valuing any other agreements in that category.

FICO credit scores are refreshed periodically by the firm to assess the updated creditworthiness of the borrower. As of\\nDecember\\xa02017 and December\\xa02016, greater than 80% of the Marcus loans receivable had an underlying FICO credit score above 660 (with a weighted average FICO credit score in excess of 700). \\nFor PCI loans, the firm\\x92s risk assessment process includes reviewing certain key metrics, such as delinquency status, collateral values,\\nexpected cash flows and other risk factors.  Impaired Loans. Loans receivable (excluding PCI loans) are determined to be impaired when it is probable that the firm will not be able to collect all principal and interest due under the contractual terms of the loan. At that\\ntime, loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status and all accrued but uncollected interest is reversed against interest income, and interest subsequently collected is recognized on a cash basis to the extent the loan balance is deemed\\ncollectible. Otherwise, all cash received is used to reduce the outstanding loan balance.  In certain circumstances, the firm may\\nalso modify the original terms of a loan agreement by granting a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty. Such modifications are considered troubled debt restructurings and typically include interest rate reductions, payment\\nextensions, and modification of loan covenants. Loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring are considered impaired and are subject to specific loan-level reserves.\\nAs of December\\xa02017 and December\\xa02016, the gross carrying value of impaired loans receivable (excluding PCI loans) on nonaccrual\\nstatus was $845\\xa0million and $404\\xa0million, respectively. As of December\\xa02017 and December\\xa02016, such loans included $61\\xa0million and $142\\xa0million, respectively, of corporate loans that were modified in a troubled debt\\nrestructuring. The firm did not have any lending commitments related to these loans as of December\\xa02017. Such lending commitments were $144\\xa0million as of December\\xa02016. \\nWhen it is determined that the firm cannot reasonably estimate expected cash flows on PCI loans or pools of loans, such loans are placed on\\nnonaccrual status. \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n144\\n\\xa0\\nGoldman\\xa0Sachs\\xa02017\\xa0Form 10-K\\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

For loans receivable (excluding PCI and Marcus loans) and lending commitments, the firm performs credit\\nreviews which include initial and ongoing analyses of its borrowers. A credit review is an independent analysis of the capacity and willingness of a borrower to meet its financial obligations, resulting in an internal credit rating. The\\ndetermination of internal credit ratings also incorporates assumptions with respect to the nature of and outlook for the borrower\\x92s industry and the economic environment. The firm also assigns a regulatory risk rating to such loans based on the\\ndefinitions provided by the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies. The firm enters into economic hedges to mitigate credit risk on\\ncertain loans receivable and corporate lending commitments (both of which are held for investment) related to the firm\\x92s relationship lending activities. Such hedges are accounted for at fair value. See Note\\xa018 for further information\\nabout these lending commitments and associated hedges. The table below presents gross loans receivable (excluding PCI and Marcus loans of\\n$6.37\\xa0billion and $4.18\\xa0billion as of December\\xa02017 and December\\xa02016, respectively) and lending commitments by the firm\\x92s internally determined public rating agency equivalent and by regulatory risk rating. \\xa0Credit Rating EquivalentAs of December\\xa02017Investment-gradeNon-investment-gradeTotal\\xa0As of December\\xa02016Investment-gradeNon-investment-gradeTotal\\xa0Regulatory Risk RatingAs of December\\xa02017Non-criticized/passCriticizedTotal\\xa0As of December\\xa02016Non-criticized/passCriticizedTotalIn the table above, non-criticized/pass loans and lending commitments\\nrepresent loans and lending commitments that are performing and/or do not demonstrate adverse characteristics that are likely to result in a credit loss.\\n\\nFor Marcus loans, an important credit-quality indicator is the Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO)\\ncredit score, which measures a borrower\\x92s creditworthiness by considering factors such as payment and credit history. FICO credit scores are refreshed periodically by the firm to assess the updated creditworthiness of the borrower. As of\\nDecember\\xa02017 and December\\xa02016, greater than 80% of the Marcus loans receivable had an underlying FICO credit score above 660 (with a weighted average FICO credit score in excess of 700). \\nFor PCI loans, the firm\\x92s risk assessment process includes reviewing certain key metrics, such as delinquency status, collateral values,\\nexpected cash flows and other risk factors.  Impaired Loans. Loans receivable (excluding PCI loans) are determined to be impaired when it is probable that the firm will not be able to collect all principal and interest due under the contractual terms of the loan. At that\\ntime, loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status and all accrued but uncollected interest is reversed against interest income, and interest subsequently collected is recognized on a cash basis to the extent the loan balance is deemed\\ncollectible. Otherwise, all cash received is used to reduce the outstanding loan balance.  In certain circumstances, the firm may\\nalso modify the original terms of a loan agreement by granting a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty. Such modifications are considered troubled debt restructurings and typically include interest rate reductions, payment\\nextensions, and modification of loan covenants. Loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring are considered impaired and are subject to specific loan-level reserves.\\nAs of December\\xa02017 and December\\xa02016, the gross carrying value of impaired loans receivable (excluding PCI loans) on nonaccrual\\nstatus was $845\\xa0million and $404\\xa0million, respectively. As of December\\xa02017 and December\\xa02016, such loans included $61\\xa0million and $142\\xa0million, respectively, of corporate loans that were modified in a troubled debt\\nrestructuring. The firm did not have any lending commitments related to these loans as of December\\xa02017. Such lending commitments were $144\\xa0million as of December\\xa02016. \\nWhen it is determined that the firm cannot reasonably estimate expected cash flows on PCI loans or pools of loans, such loans are placed on\\nnonaccrual status. For Marcus loans, an important credit-quality indicator is the Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO)\\ncredit score, which measures a borrower\\x92s creditworthiness by considering factors such as payment and credit history. FICO credit scores are refreshed periodically by the firm to assess the updated creditworthiness of the borrower. As of\\nDecember\\xa02017 and December\\xa02016, greater than 80% of the Marcus loans receivable had an underlying FICO credit score above 660 (with a weighted average FICO credit score in excess of 700).

Resale and Repurchase Agreements\\n A resale agreement is a transaction in which the firm purchases financial instruments from a seller, typically in exchange for cash,\\nand simultaneously enters into an agreement to resell the same or substantially the same financial instruments to the seller at a stated price plus accrued interest at a future date. \\nA repurchase agreement is a transaction in which the firm sells financial instruments to a buyer, typically in exchange for cash, and\\nsimultaneously enters into an agreement to repurchase the same or substantially the same financial instruments from the buyer at a stated price plus accrued interest at a future date. \\nEven though repurchase and resale agreements (including \\x93repos- and\\nreverses-to-maturity\\x94) involve the legal transfer of ownership of financial instruments, they are accounted for as financing arrangements because they require the\\nfinancial instruments to be repurchased or resold before or at the maturity of the agreement. The financial instruments purchased or sold in resale and repurchase agreements typically include U.S. government and agency, and investment-grade\\nsovereign obligations. \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n146\\n\\xa0\\nGoldman\\xa0Sachs\\xa02017\\xa0Form 10-K\\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Securitization Activities\\n The firm securitizes residential and commercial mortgages, corporate bonds, loans and other types of financial assets by selling these\\nassets to securitization vehicles (e.g., trusts, corporate entities and limited liability companies) or through a resecuritization. The firm acts as underwriter of the beneficial interests that are sold to investors. The firm\\x92s residential\\nmortgage securitizations are primarily in connection with government agency securitizations.  Beneficial interests issued by securitization\\nentities are debt or equity instruments that give the investors rights to receive all or portions of specified cash inflows to a securitization vehicle and include senior and subordinated interests in principal, interest and/or other cash inflows.\\nThe proceeds from the sale of beneficial interests are used to pay the transferor for the financial assets sold to the securitization vehicle or to purchase securities which serve as collateral.\\n\\nThe firm accounts for a securitization as a sale when it has relinquished control over the\\ntransferred financial assets. Prior to securitization, the firm generally accounts for assets pending transfer at fair value and therefore does not typically recognize significant gains or losses upon the transfer of assets. Net revenues from\\nunderwriting activities are recognized in connection with the sales of the underlying beneficial interests to investors.  For transfers of\\nfinancial assets that are not accounted for as sales, the assets remain in financial instruments owned and the transfer is accounted for as a collateralized financing, with the related interest expense recognized over the life of the transaction.\\nSee Notes\\xa010 and 23 for further information about collateralized financings and interest expense, respectively.  The firm generally\\nreceives cash in exchange for the transferred assets but may also have continuing involvement with the transferred financial assets, including ownership of beneficial interests in securitized financial assets, primarily in the form of debt\\ninstruments. The firm may also purchase senior or subordinated securities issued by securitization vehicles (which are typically VIEs) in connection with secondary market-making activities. \\nThe primary risks included in beneficial interests and other interests from the firm\\x92s continuing involvement with securitization vehicles\\nare the performance of the underlying collateral, the position of the firm\\x92s investment in the capital structure of the securitization vehicle and the market yield for the security. These interests primarily are accounted for at fair value and\\nclassified in level\\xa02 of the fair value hierarchy. Beneficial interests and other interests not accounted for at fair value are carried at amounts that approximate fair value. See Notes\\xa05 through 8 for further information about fair value\\nmeasurements.

Certain interest rate, foreign currency and credit\\nderivatives the firm enters into with VIEs are not variable interests because they create, rather than absorb, risk.

The firm reassesses its determination of whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE on an ongoing basis based on current facts and circumstances. \\nVIE Activities  In 2017, the firm aggregated\\ncorporate debt VIEs with other asset-backed VIEs and aggregated power-related VIEs with real estate, credit-related and other investing VIEs (rather than in investments in funds and other VIEs). Previously reported amounts have been conformed to the\\ncurrent presentation.  The firm is principally involved with VIEs through the following business activities: \\nMortgage-Backed VIEs. The firm sells residential and\\ncommercial mortgage loans and securities to mortgage-backed VIEs and may retain beneficial interests in the assets sold to these VIEs. The firm purchases and sells beneficial interests issued by mortgage-backed VIEs in connection with market-making\\nactivities. In addition, the firm may enter into derivatives with certain of these VIEs, primarily interest rate swaps, which are typically not variable interests. The firm generally enters into derivatives with other counterparties to mitigate its\\nrisk.  Real Estate, Credit- and Power-Related and Other Investing VIEs. The firm purchases equity and debt securities issued by and makes loans to VIEs that hold real estate, performing and nonperforming debt, distressed loans, power-related assets and equity securities. The firm\\ntypically does not sell assets to, or enter into derivatives with, these VIEs.  Corporate Debt\\nand Other Asset-Backed VIEs. The firm structures VIEs that issue notes to clients, and purchases and sells beneficial interests issued by corporate debt and other asset-backed VIEs in connection\\nwith market-making activities. Certain of these VIEs synthetically create the exposure for the beneficial interests they issue by entering into credit derivatives with the firm, rather than purchasing the underlying assets. In addition, the firm may\\nenter into derivatives, such as total return swaps, with certain corporate debt and other asset-backed VIEs, under which the firm pays the VIE a return due to the beneficial interest holders and receives the return on the collateral owned by the\\nVIE. The collateral owned by these VIEs is primarily other asset-backed loans and securities. The firm generally can be removed as the total return swap counterparty and enters into derivatives with other counterparties to mitigate its risk related\\nto these swaps. The firm may sell assets to the corporate debt and other asset-backed VIEs it structures. \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n152\\n\\xa0\\nGoldman\\xa0Sachs\\xa02017\\xa0Form 10-K\\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Goodwill is assessed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if\\nevents occur or circumstances change that indicate an impairment may exist. When assessing goodwill for impairment, first, qualitative factors are assessed to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is\\nless than its carrying value. If the results of the qualitative assessment are not conclusive, a quantitative goodwill test is performed.\\n\\nThe quantitative goodwill test compares the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its\\nestimated net book value (including goodwill and identifiable intangible assets). If the reporting unit\\x92s estimated fair value exceeds its estimated net book value, goodwill is not impaired. An impairment is recognized if the estimated fair\\nvalue of a reporting unit is less than its estimated net book value, with the amount of impairment equal to the difference between those values. To estimate the fair value of each reporting unit, a relative value technique is used because the firm\\nbelieves market participants would use this technique to value the firm\\x92s reporting units. The relative value technique applies observable price-to-earnings\\nmultiples or price-to-book multiples and projected return on equity of comparable competitors to reporting units\\x92 net earnings or net book value. The estimated net\\nbook value of each reporting unit reflects an allocation of total shareholders\\x92 equity and represents the estimated amount of total shareholders\\x92 equity required to support the activities of the reporting unit under currently applicable\\nregulatory capital requirements.  In the fourth quarter of 2017, the firm assessed goodwill for impairment for each of its reporting units\\nby performing a qualitative assessment. Multiple factors were assessed with respect to each of the firm\\x92s reporting units to determine whether it was more likely than not that the estimated fair value of any of these reporting units was less\\nthan its estimated carrying value. The qualitative assessment also considered changes since the prior quantitative tests.  The firm\\nconsidered the following factors in the qualitative assessment performed in the fourth quarter when evaluating whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit was less than its carrying value: \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Performance Indicators.

However, Tax Legislation will result in a lower effective income tax rate in the future. See Note\\xa024 for further information about Tax Legislation.

During any such deferral period, the firm\\nwill not be permitted to, among other things, pay dividends on or make certain repurchases of its common stock. The Trust is not permitted to pay any distributions on the common beneficial interests held by Group Inc. unless all dividends payable on\\nthe preferred beneficial interests have been paid in full. Junior Subordinated Debt Issued in Connection with Trust\\nPreferred Securities. Group Inc. issued $2.84\\xa0billion of junior subordinated debt in 2004 to Goldman Sachs Capital\\xa0I (Trust), a Delaware statutory trust. The Trust issued\\n$2.75\\xa0billion of guaranteed preferred beneficial interests (Trust Preferred Securities) to third parties and $85\\xa0million of common beneficial interests to Group Inc. and used the proceeds from the issuances to purchase the junior\\nsubordinated debt from Group Inc. As of December\\xa02017, the outstanding par amount of junior subordinated debt held by the Trust was $1.17\\xa0billion and the outstanding par amount of Trust Preferred Securities and common beneficial interests\\nissued by the Trust was $1.13\\xa0billion and $35.1\\xa0million, respectively. During 2017, the firm purchased $186\\xa0million (par amount) of Trust Preferred Securities and delivered these securities, along with $5.7\\xa0million of common\\nbeneficial interests, to the Trust in exchange for a corresponding par amount of the junior subordinated debt. Following the exchanges, these Trust Preferred Securities, common beneficial interests and junior subordinated debt were extinguished. As\\nof December\\xa02016, the outstanding par amount of junior subordinated debt held by the Trust was $1.36\\xa0billion and the outstanding par amount of Trust Preferred Securities and common beneficial interests issued by the Trust was\\n$1.32\\xa0billion and $40.8\\xa0million, respectively. The Trust is a wholly-owned finance subsidiary of the firm for regulatory and legal purposes but is not consolidated for accounting purposes. The firm pays interest semi-annually on the junior subordinated debt at an annual rate of 6.345% and the debt matures on\\nFebruary\\xa015,\\xa02034. The coupon rate and the payment dates applicable to the beneficial interests are the same as the interest rate and payment dates for the junior subordinated debt. The firm has the right, from time to time, to defer\\npayment of interest on the junior subordinated debt, and therefore cause payment on the Trust\\x92s preferred beneficial interests to be deferred, in each case up to ten consecutive semi-annual periods. During any such deferral period, the firm\\nwill not be permitted to, among other things, pay dividends on or make certain repurchases of its common stock. The Trust is not permitted to pay any distributions on the common beneficial interests held by Group Inc. unless all dividends payable on\\nthe preferred beneficial interests have been paid in full. \\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES \\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \\xa0\\n\\nCommercial Lending. The firm\\x92s commercial lending commitments are extended to investment-grade and non-investment-grade corporate borrowers. Commitments to investment-grade\\ncorporate borrowers are principally used for operating liquidity and general corporate purposes. The firm also extends lending commitments in connection with contingent acquisition financing and other types of corporate lending, as well as\\ncommercial real estate financing. Commitments that are extended for contingent acquisition financing are often intended to be short-term in nature, as borrowers often seek to replace them with other funding sources. \\nSumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Inc. (SMFG) provides the firm with credit loss protection on certain approved loan commitments (primarily\\ninvestment-grade commercial lending commitments). The notional amount of such loan commitments was $25.70\\xa0billion and $26.88\\xa0billion as of December\\xa02017 and December\\xa02016, respectively. The credit loss protection on loan\\ncommitments provided by SMFG is generally limited to 95% of the first loss the firm realizes on such commitments, up to a maximum of approximately $950\\xa0million. In addition, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, upon the\\nfirm\\x92s request, SMFG will provide protection for 70% of additional losses on such commitments, up to a maximum of $1.13\\xa0billion, of which $550\\xa0million and $768\\xa0million of protection had been provided as of December\\xa02017 and\\nDecember\\xa02016, respectively. The firm also uses other financial instruments to mitigate credit risks related to certain commitments not covered by SMFG. These instruments primarily include credit default swaps that reference the same or similar\\nunderlying instrument or entity, or credit default swaps that reference a market index.  Warehouse\\nFinancing. The firm provides financing to clients who warehouse financial assets. These arrangements are secured by the warehoused assets, primarily consisting of retail and corporate loans.\\n\\nContingent and Forward Starting Collateralized Agreements / Forward Starting Collateralized Financings\\n Contingent and forward starting collateralized agreements includes resale and securities borrowing agreements, and forward starting\\ncollateralized financings includes repurchase and secured lending agreements that settle at a future date, generally within three business days. The firm also enters into commitments to provide contingent financing to its clients and counterparties\\nthrough resale agreements. The firm\\x92s funding of these commitments depends on the satisfaction of all contractual conditions to the resale agreement and these commitments can expire unused. \\nLetters of Credit  The firm has commitments under\\nletters of credit issued by various banks which the firm provides to counterparties in lieu of securities or cash to satisfy various collateral and margin deposit requirements. \\nInvestment Commitments  Investment commitments\\nincludes commitments to invest in private equity, real estate and other assets directly and through funds that the firm raises and manages.

AND SUBSIDIARIES \\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \\xa0\\n\\nDerivative Guarantees. The firm enters into various derivatives that meet the definition of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP, including written equity and commodity put options, written currency contracts and interest rate caps, floors and\\nswaptions. These derivatives are risk managed together with derivatives that do not meet the definition of a guarantee, and therefore the amounts in the table above do not reflect the firm\\x92s overall risk related to its derivative activities.\\nDisclosures about derivatives are not required if they may be cash settled and the firm has no basis to conclude it is probable that the counterparties held the underlying instruments at inception of the contract. The firm has concluded that these\\nconditions have been met for certain large, internationally active commercial and investment bank counterparties, central clearing counterparties and certain other counterparties. Accordingly, the firm has not included such contracts in the table\\nabove. In addition, see Note\\xa07 for information about credit derivatives that meet the definition of a guarantee, which are not included in the table above. \\nDerivatives are accounted for at fair value and therefore the carrying value is considered the best indication of payment/performance risk for\\nindividual contracts. However, the carrying values in the table above exclude the effect of counterparty and cash collateral netting.  Securities Lending Indemnifications. The firm, in its capacity as an agency lender, indemnifies most of its securities lending customers against losses incurred\\nin the event that borrowers do not return securities and the collateral held is insufficient to cover the market value of the securities borrowed. Collateral held by the lenders in connection with securities lending indemnifications was\\n$39.03\\xa0billion and $34.33\\xa0billion as of December\\xa02017 and December\\xa02016, respectively. Because the contractual nature of these arrangements requires the firm to obtain collateral with a market value that exceeds the value of the\\nsecurities lent to the borrower, there is minimal performance risk associated with these guarantees. \\nOther Financial Guarantees. In the ordinary course of\\nbusiness, the firm provides other financial guarantees of the obligations of third parties (e.g., standby letters of credit and other guarantees to enable clients to complete transactions and fund-related guarantees). These guarantees represent\\nobligations to make payments to beneficiaries if the guaranteed party fails to fulfill its obligation under a contractual arrangement with that beneficiary.\\n\\nGuarantees of Securities Issued by Trusts. The firm has established trusts, including Goldman Sachs Capital\\xa0I, the APEX Trusts and other entities for the limited purpose of issuing securities to third parties, lending the proceeds to the firm and\\nentering into contractual arrangements with the firm and third parties related to this purpose. The firm does not consolidate these entities. See Note\\xa016 for further information about the transactions involving Goldman Sachs Capital\\xa0I and\\nthe APEX Trusts.  The firm effectively provides for the full and unconditional guarantee of the securities issued by these entities.\\nTimely payment by the firm of amounts due to these entities under the guarantee, borrowing, preferred stock and related contractual arrangements will be sufficient to cover payments due on the securities issued by these entities. \\nManagement believes that it is unlikely that any circumstances will occur, such as nonperformance on the part of paying agents or other service\\nproviders, that would make it necessary for the firm to make payments related to these entities other than those required under the terms of the guarantee, borrowing, preferred stock and related contractual arrangements and in connection with\\ncertain expenses incurred by these entities.  Indemnities and Guarantees of Service\\nProviders. In the ordinary course of business, the firm indemnifies and guarantees certain service providers, such as clearing and custody agents, trustees and administrators, against specified\\npotential losses in connection with their acting as an agent of, or providing services to, the firm or its affiliates.  The firm may\\nalso be liable to some clients or other parties for losses arising from its custodial role or caused by acts or omissions of third-party service providers, including sub-custodians and third-party brokers. In\\ncertain cases, the firm has the right to seek indemnification from these third-party service providers for certain relevant losses incurred by the firm. In addition, the firm is a member of payment, clearing and settlement networks, as well as\\nsecurities exchanges around the world that may require the firm to meet the obligations of such networks and exchanges in the event of member defaults and other loss scenarios. \\nIn connection with the firm\\x92s prime brokerage and clearing businesses, the firm agrees to clear and settle on behalf of its clients the\\ntransactions entered into by them with other brokerage firms. The firm\\x92s obligations in respect of such transactions are secured by the assets in the client\\x92s account, as well as any proceeds received from the transactions cleared and\\nsettled by the firm on behalf of the client. In connection with joint venture investments, the firm may issue loan guarantees under which it may be liable in the event of fraud, misappropriation, environmental liabilities and certain other matters\\ninvolving the borrower. \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGoldman\\xa0Sachs\\xa02017\\xa0Form 10-K\\n\\xa0\\n165\\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

(Board) declared a dividend of $0.75 per common share to be paid on March\\xa029,\\xa02018 to common shareholders of record on\\nMarch\\xa01,\\xa02018. The firm\\x92s share repurchase program is intended to help maintain the appropriate level of common equity. The\\nshare repurchase program is effected primarily through regular open-market purchases (which may include repurchase plans designed to comply with Rule\\xa010b5-1), the amounts and timing of which are\\ndetermined primarily by the firm\\x92s current and projected capital position, but which may also be influenced by general market conditions and the prevailing price and trading volumes of the firm\\x92s common stock. Prior to repurchasing common\\nstock, the firm must receive confirmation that the FRB does not object to such capital action. The table below presents the amount of\\ncommon stock repurchased by the firm under the share repurchase program. \\xa0Common share repurchasesAverage cost per shareTotal cost of common share repurchasesPursuant to the terms of certain share-based compensation plans, employees may remit shares to the firm or the\\nfirm may cancel RSUs or stock options to satisfy minimum statutory employee tax withholding requirements and the exercise price of stock options. Under these plans, during 2017,\\xa02016 and 2015, 12,165 shares, 49,374 shares and 35,217 shares were\\nremitted with a total value of $3\\xa0million, $7\\xa0million and $6\\xa0million, and the firm cancelled 8.1\\xa0million, 6.1\\xa0million and 5.7\\xa0million of RSUs with a total value of $1.94\\xa0billion, $921\\xa0million and\\n$1.03\\xa0billion, respectively. Under these plans, the firm also cancelled 4.6\\xa0million, 5.5\\xa0million and 2.0\\xa0million of stock options with a total value of $1.09\\xa0billion, $1.11\\xa0billion and $406\\xa0million during\\n2017,\\xa02016 and 2015, respectively. \\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Following the exchange, these shares of Series\\xa0E\\nand Series\\xa0F Preferred Stock were cancelled. The difference between the fair value of the APEX and the net carrying value of the preferred stock at the time of cancellation was $266\\xa0million.

As a BHC, the firm is subject to consolidated regulatory capital requirements which are calculated in accordance with the risk-based capital and leverage\\nregulations of the FRB, subject to certain transitional provisions (Capital Framework).  The risk-based capital requirements are expressed\\nas capital ratios that compare measures of regulatory capital to risk-weighted assets (RWAs). Failure to comply with these capital requirements could result in restrictions being imposed by the firm\\x92s regulators.

Furthermore, certain of the firm\\x92s subsidiaries are subject to separate regulations and capital requirements as\\ndescribed below.  Capital Framework  The\\nregulations under the Capital Framework are largely based on the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision\\x92s (Basel Committee) capital framework for strengthening international capital standards (Basel\\xa0III) and also implement certain\\nprovisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Under the Capital Framework, the firm is an \\x93Advanced approach\\x94 banking organization and has been designated as a global systemically important bank (G-SIB). \\nThe firm calculates its Common Equity Tier\\xa01 (CET1), Tier\\xa01 capital and Total capital ratios in accordance with (i)\\xa0the\\nStandardized approach and market risk rules set out in the Capital Framework (together, the Standardized Capital Rules) and (ii)\\xa0the Advanced approach and market risk rules set out in the Capital Framework (together, the Basel\\xa0III Advanced\\nRules).

These include capital buffers and\\ncertain deductions from regulatory capital (such as investments in nonconsolidated financial institutions). These deductions from regulatory capital are required to be phased in ratably per year from 2014 to 2018, with residual amounts not deducted\\nduring the transitional period subject to risk weighting. In addition, junior subordinated debt issued to trusts is being phased out of regulatory capital. The minimum CET1, Tier\\xa01 and Total capital ratios that apply to the firm will increase\\nas the capital buffers are phased in.  The capital conservation buffer, which consists entirely of capital that qualifies as CET1, began to\\nphase in on January\\xa01,\\xa02016 and will continue to do so in increments of 0.625% per year until it reaches 2.5% of RWAs on January\\xa01,\\xa02019.\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGoldman\\xa0Sachs\\xa02017\\xa0Form 10-K\\n\\xa0\\n169\\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The $4.40\\xa0billion income tax expense includes the repatriation tax on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, the effects of the implementation of a territorial tax system and the\\nremeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets at lower enacted tax rates.  The repatriation tax is based on the greater of the firm\\x92s\\npost-1986 earnings and profits as of November\\xa02,\\xa02017 or December\\xa031,\\xa02017. Income taxes paid or payable to foreign jurisdictions partially reduce the repatriation tax as a foreign tax credit, based on a formula that includes\\nfuture earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries. The calculation resulted in an estimated income tax expense of $3.32\\xa0billion.  U.S.\\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities were required to be remeasured as of December\\xa022,\\xa02017 to the new U.S. federal income tax rate of 21% and to any federal impact associated with state and local deferred income taxes, as well as due to\\nthe implementation of the territorial tax system. This remeasurement resulted in an estimated income tax expense of $1.08\\xa0billion. \\nWhile the components of the impact of Tax Legislation described above were calculated to account for all available information, these amounts\\nare estimates. The firm anticipates modification to the estimate may occur as a result of (i)\\xa0refinement of the firm\\x92s calculations based on updated information, (ii)\\xa0changes in the firm\\x92s interpretations and assumptions,\\n(iii)\\xa0updates from issuance of future legislative guidance and (iv)\\xa0actions the firm may take as a result of Tax Legislation.  Provision for Income\\nTaxes  Income taxes are provided for using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are\\nrecognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities.

If not utilized, the U.S. federal, state and local, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2018. If these carryforwards\\nexpire, they will not have a material impact on the firm\\x92s results of operations. As of December\\xa02017, the foreign tax credit carryforwards were $446\\xa0million, the general business credit carryforwards were $533\\xa0million and the\\nstate and local tax credit carryforwards were $27\\xa0million. If not utilized, the foreign tax credit carryforward will begin to expire in 2027, the general business credit carryforward will begin to expire in 2037, and the state and local tax\\ncredit carryforward will begin to expire in 2020.  The firm had no capital loss carryforwards and no related net deferred income tax assets\\nas of December\\xa02017 and December\\xa02016.  The valuation allowance increased by $41\\xa0million during 2017 and increased by\\n$42\\xa0million during 2016. The increases in 2017 and 2016 were primarily due to an increase in deferred tax assets from which the firm does not expect to realize any benefit. \\nThe firm permanently reinvested eligible earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries. As of December\\xa02017, substantially all U.S. taxes were\\naccrued on these subsidiaries\\x92 earnings and profits as a result of Tax Legislation repatriation tax. As of December\\xa02016, the firm did not accrue any U.S. income taxes that would arise if such earnings were repatriated, resulting in an\\nunrecognized net deferred tax liability of $6.18\\xa0billion, attributable to reinvested earnings of $31.24\\xa0billion.  Unrecognized Tax Benefits \\nThe firm recognizes tax positions in the consolidated financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the position will be\\nsustained on examination by the relevant taxing authority based on the technical merits of the position. A position that meets this standard is measured at the largest amount of benefit that will more likely than not be realized on settlement. A\\nliability is established for differences between positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements.\\n\\nThe accrued liability for interest expense related to income tax matters and income tax\\npenalties was $81\\xa0million and $141\\xa0million as of December\\xa02017 and December\\xa02016, respectively. The firm recognized interest expense and income tax penalties of $63\\xa0million, $27\\xa0million and $17\\xa0million for\\n2017,\\xa02016 and 2015, respectively. It is reasonably possible that unrecognized tax benefits could change significantly during the twelve months subsequent to December\\xa02017 due to potential audit settlements. However, at this time it is not\\npossible to estimate any potential change.  The table below presents the changes in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits.

As of December\\xa02016, the firm did not accrue any U.S. income taxes that would arise if such earnings were repatriated, resulting in an\\nunrecognized net deferred tax liability of $6.18\\xa0billion, attributable to reinvested earnings of $31.24\\xa0billion.  Unrecognized Tax Benefits \\nThe firm recognizes tax positions in the consolidated financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the position will be\\nsustained on examination by the relevant taxing authority based on the technical merits of the position. A position that meets this standard is measured at the largest amount of benefit that will more likely than not be realized on settlement. A\\nliability is established for differences between positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements.\\nAs of December\\xa02017, the U.S. federal, state and local, and foreign net operating loss\\ncarryforwards were $268\\xa0million, $1.33\\xa0billion and $1.23\\xa0billion, respectively. If not utilized, the U.S. federal, state and local, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2018. If these carryforwards\\nexpire, they will not have a material impact on the firm\\x92s results of operations. As of December\\xa02017, the foreign tax credit carryforwards were $446\\xa0million, the general business credit carryforwards were $533\\xa0million and the\\nstate and local tax credit carryforwards were $27\\xa0million. If not utilized, the foreign tax credit carryforward will begin to expire in 2027, the general business credit carryforward will begin to expire in 2037, and the state and local tax\\ncredit carryforward will begin to expire in 2020. The firm had no capital loss carryforwards and no related net deferred income tax assets\\nas of December\\xa02017 and December\\xa02016. The valuation allowance increased by $41\\xa0million during 2017 and increased by\\n$42\\xa0million during 2016.

A\\nliability is established for differences between positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements.\\n\\nThe accrued liability for interest expense related to income tax matters and income tax\\npenalties was $81\\xa0million and $141\\xa0million as of December\\xa02017 and December\\xa02016, respectively. The firm recognized interest expense and income tax penalties of $63\\xa0million, $27\\xa0million and $17\\xa0million for\\n2017,\\xa02016 and 2015, respectively. It is reasonably possible that unrecognized tax benefits could change significantly during the twelve months subsequent to December\\xa02017 due to potential audit settlements.

Business Segments \\nThe firm reports its activities in the following four business segments: Investment Banking, Institutional Client Services,\\nInvesting\\xa0& Lending and Investment Management.  Basis of Presentation \\nIn reporting segments, certain of the firm\\x92s business lines have been aggregated where they have similar economic characteristics and are\\nsimilar in each of the following areas: (i)\\xa0the nature of the services they provide, (ii)\\xa0their methods of distribution, (iii)\\xa0the types of clients they serve and (iv)\\xa0the regulatory environments in which they operate. \\nThe cost drivers of the firm taken as a whole, compensation, headcount and levels of business activity, are broadly similar in each of the\\nfirm\\x92s business segments. Compensation and benefits expenses in the firm\\x92s segments reflect, among other factors, the overall performance of the firm, as well as the performance of individual businesses. Consequently, pre-tax margins in one segment of the firm\\x92s business may be significantly affected by the performance of the firm\\x92s other business segments.\\n\\nThe firm allocates assets (including allocations of global core liquid assets and cash, secured\\nclient financing and other assets), revenues and expenses among the four business segments. Due to the integrated nature of these segments, estimates and judgments are made in allocating certain assets, revenues and expenses. The allocation process\\nis based on the manner in which management currently views the performance of the segments. Transactions between segments are based on specific criteria or approximate third-party rates. \\nThe table below presents the firm\\x92s net revenues, pre-tax earnings and total assets by

During the first quarter of 2017, the firm concluded examinations with the Hong Kong tax authorities related to 2007 through 2015, with 2011\\nthrough 2015 subject to final review. The completion of these examinations did not have a material impact on the firm\\x92s effective income tax rate. All years including and subsequent to the years in the table above remain open to examination by the taxing authorities. The firm believes that\\nthe liability for unrecognized tax benefits it has established is adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments. Note\\xa025. Business Segments The firm reports its activities in the following four business segments: Investment Banking, Institutional Client Services,\\nInvesting\\xa0& Lending and Investment Management. Basis of Presentation In reporting segments, certain of the firm\\x92s business lines have been aggregated where they have similar economic characteristics and are\\nsimilar in each of the following areas: (i)\\xa0the nature of the services they provide, (ii)\\xa0their methods of distribution, (iii)\\xa0the types of clients they serve and (iv)\\xa0the regulatory environments in which they operate. The cost drivers of the firm taken as a whole, compensation, headcount and levels of business activity, are broadly similar in each of the\\nfirm\\x92s business segments. Compensation and benefits expenses in the firm\\x92s segments reflect, among other factors, the overall performance of the firm, as well as the performance of individual businesses. Consequently, pre-tax margins in one segment of the firm\\x92s business may be significantly affected by the performance of the firm\\x92s other business segments.\\n\\nThe firm allocates assets (including allocations of global core liquid assets and cash, secured\\nclient financing and other assets), revenues and expenses among the four business segments. Due to the integrated nature of these segments, estimates and judgments are made in allocating certain assets, revenues and expenses. The allocation process\\nis based on the manner in which management currently views the performance of the segments. Transactions between segments are based on specific criteria or approximate third-party rates. \\nThe table below presents the firm\\x92s net revenues, pre-tax earnings and total assets by segment.\\nManagement believes that this information provides a reasonable representation of each segment\\x92s contribution to consolidated pre-tax earnings and total assets.

AND SUBSIDIARIES \\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \\xa0\\n\\nIn June\\xa02012, the Board received a demand from a shareholder that the Board investigate and\\ntake action relating to the firm\\x92s mortgage-related activities and to stock sales by certain directors and executives of the firm. On February\\xa015,\\xa02013, this shareholder filed a putative shareholder derivative action in New York\\nSupreme Court, New York County, against Group Inc. and certain current or former directors and employees, based on these activities and stock sales. The derivative complaint includes allegations of breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, abuse\\nof control, gross mismanagement and corporate waste, and seeks, among other things, unspecified monetary damages, disgorgement of profits and certain corporate governance and disclosure reforms. On May\\xa028,\\xa02013, Group Inc. informed the\\nshareholder that the Board completed its investigation and determined to refuse the demand. On June\\xa020,\\xa02013, the shareholder made a books and records demand requesting materials relating to the Board\\x92s determination. The parties have\\nagreed to stay proceedings in the putative derivative action pending resolution of the books and records demand.

Credit exposure represents the potential for loss due to the default or deterioration in credit quality of a\\ncounterparty or an issuer of securities or other instruments the firm holds and is measured based on the potential loss in an event of non-payment by a counterparty. Credit exposure is reduced through the\\neffect of risk mitigants, such as netting agreements with counterparties that permit the firm to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties or obtaining collateral from counterparties. The table below does not include all the effects\\nof such risk mitigants and does not represent the firm\\x92s credit exposure.\\n\\nThe table below presents cross-border outstandings and commitments
