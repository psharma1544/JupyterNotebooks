GS,10-K,d480167d10k.htm,s114,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/886982/000156459019008879/gs-424b2.htm,Because of the U.S. tax treatment applicable to your notes tax liabilities could affect the after-tax rate of return on your notes to a comparatively greater extent than the after-tax return on the underlier stocks.The levels in the left column of the table below represent hypothetical final underlier levels and are expressed as percentages of the initial underlier level
