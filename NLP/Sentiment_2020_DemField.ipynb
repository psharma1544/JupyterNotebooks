The social media outcry over the threat to its funding stream is boosting the Special Olympics\\' message — and private donations are expected to surge. It also shows the political risk for the Trump administration when it targets an educational program beloved by Democrats and Republicans alike.Story Continued Below“It’s a little bit overwhelming in the best way possible,” said Andrea Cahn, senior director of the organization’s Unified Champion Schools program, through which the federal money is distributed.\"In some ways the most powerless, vulnerable, forgotten people in the country brought to their knees the most powerful people in the country,\" said Tim Shriver, chairman of Special Olympics International, speaking on Monday to advocates gathered at the Save the Children and Save the Children Action Network Advocacy Summit in Washington, D.C.\"Probably in my 39 years of professional life, I’ve never had more attention than we got last week on anything I’ve ever worked on, honestly,\" he said.President Donald Trump last week backpedaled on his proposal to eliminate funding for the program after two days of intense criticism on social media.

All of Trump\\'s budget requests since he took office have proposed doing away with federal support for Special Olympics, and they\\'ve all been rejected by Congress. Instead, the funding has risen sharply from $7.6 million in fiscal 2015 to $17.6 million in fiscal 2019. Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), who heads up the Appropriations panel that funds education, is a Special Olympics champion.Acting White House chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney on Sunday defended the budget process that led to the decision to cut funding, saying on CNN’s “State of the Union” that “debates take place all the time” and that “when the president realized that the public wanted this money, he made the change.”DeVos stuck up for the proposed cut before a Senate subcommittee but also pointed out that she didn’t “personally get involved” in the decision to slash funding. After Trump said the funding would be restored, she lauded the decision, saying she had fought for the money “behind the scenes over the last several years.” DeVos last year announced she would donate nearly $50,000, a fourth of her salary, to the Special Olympics.Maria Shriver, who is Tim\\'s sister, and former Gov. John Kasich (R-Ohio) penned a CNN column on Friday, attributing Trump’s reversal to the “loud and bipartisan outcry.”“His swift response is a lesson for all Americans about what can be achieved when we come together, rise above our partisan concerns and use our voices to champion a cause that unites us all,” they wrote. Tim and Maria Shriver are the children of Eunice Kennedy Shriver, the program’s founder.Vice President Mike Pence’s wife, Karen Pence, who led a U.S. delegation in March to the Special Olympics World Games in the United Arab Emirates, tweeted after Trump’s announcement: “Thank you, Mr. President! Love the @SpecialOlympics!”Neither the House nor the Senate Appropriations committees have received any formal notifications of a budget revision from the Trump administration following the president’s comments. The Department of Education deferred comments on the next step to the OMB, which did not respond to an email requesting how much in funding the administration would request for the program.But after Trump’s announcement, Rep. Mark Pocan, (D-Wis.), said in a statement, “Congress was already planning to ignore the administration’s disgraceful budget request, so this is only an attempt to save face.”\\ncongress\\n                    By HEATHER CAYGLE and BURGESS EVERETTPocan and Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), who chairs the House subcommittee that oversees education spending, have already agreed to try to increase the funding for Special Olympics in appropriations legislation, given \"how strong the public support for this program is,\" Pocan told POLITICO on Friday. That bill is still being written and no specific figures for the Special Olympics were available yet. “The willingness for all the members of Congress from both sides of the aisle to step up and speak out on our behalf in a time when there doesn\\'t seem to be a lot of speaking up and taking a stand was also really gratifying,” Cahn said.The federal funding supports “unified” programs, including children with and without disabilities in the same activities, that are now in 6,500 schools. The organization says it’s on track to reach 7,500 schools by the end of this school year and 8,500 next year.The money represents a portion of the overall revenue from all sources for the Special Olympics, which reported $124 million in unrestricted revenues, gains and other support for the year ending Dec. 31, 2017, in a financial statement posted on its website.In response to the attention, Cahn said the organization pushed out positive stories about the program, changing their timeline for release “to take advantage of the attention that we were getting just to get our messaging out there.” Many media outlets picked up on the story and its local impact and the overall importance of Special Olympics programs.“You can’t do that to these kids,” said Anna Quinn, whose sons are on a Special Olympics New Jersey basketball team, to the Press of Atlantic City. “What kind of person takes away from a special needs kid?”The Austin American-Statesman’s editorial board opined: “If there is anything that should be considered untouchable, it seems Special Olympics would fall under that heading.”Since March 26, the normal volume of social media posts referencing Special Olympics had tripled and the organization saw a 200 percent increase in visitors to its website, according to a spokesperson. Once the data is gathered, Cahn expects to see a boost in donations. That’s good news for an organization with a goal of funding programs in every public and private school in the nation.“We have at least a hundred thousand more schools to go,” Cahn said. “We’re thinking that, \\'Wow, maybe it’s not going to take as long as we thought to be in every school.\\'\"Missing out on the latest scoops?

David Perdue’s disaster relief bill,” Trump tweeted. “They are blocking funding and relief for our great farmers and rural America!”Story Continued Below Negotiations around disaster aid hit a snag last week, after Democrats told Republicans that they would not back a package Perdue (R-Ga.) introduced unless it included more money for Puerto Rico, which was devastated by two hurricanes in 2017. Trump, during a closed door meeting with Republicans last week, reportedly said that Puerto Rico was getting too much storm funding.  The Senate is set to hold a crucial procedural vote this afternoon on the disaster aid proposal. The GOP-backed plan includes money for Southern and Midwestern states affected by recent storms. If the procedural vote fails, the Senate will vote on legislation passed by the Democratic-led House in January. But that\\'s not expected to get Republican support.The vote could put Senate Democrats running for president in a tough position since Iowa is among the states that would benefit from the disaster aid package.Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politicsBy signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) asked prior to the vote. The stall in negotiations comes as some communities have waited months for aid. Recent natural disasters have also complicated the process. Perdue, along with several senators including Democrat Sen. Doug Jones of Alabama, introduced the $13 billion disaster relief package in February. Last week, Senate Appropriations Chairman Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) introduced an amendment that expanded Perdue’s bill to include eligibility for disaster relief for Midwestern and Southern states. The bill also includes $600 million in nutrition assistance for Puerto Rico.   But Democrats say it’s not enough. Senate Appropriations Ranking Member Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) introduced his own amendment last week that would require that the Department of Housing and Urban Development release grant funds already allocated to the island.   Over the weekend, Puerto Rico’s Governor Ricardo Rossello urged the Senate to pass the House-approved bill, which he said, \"provides much-needed support to Puerto Rico in addressing critical infrastructure, education, nutritional, and housing needs on the island.\" He added that the Shelby amendment “falls short of addressing the majority of our most pressing needs.”  Following Trump’s tweet, Perdue praised the president for his support and blasted Democrats for the delay.  “It’s unacceptable that Washington’s intransigence continues to threaten the livelihoods of the very people who sent us here to represent them,” he said in a statement. “Every day we continue debating disaster relief is a day people across the country face crippling uncertainty.”Missing out on the latest scoops?

The possible border shutdown aims to force Mexico to step up its own immigration enforcement efforts, but would threaten billions in cross-border trade. Closing the border, it\\'s been noted widely, would do nothing to prevent migrants from seeking asylum at ports of entry or from attempting to cross the border illegally.Trump also ordered the State Department to slash aid to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, which he faults for allowing migrants to leave their countries. The recent moves come on top of Trump’s February declaration that illegal immigration constitutes a national emergency. He used the emergency declaration as part of an effort to access $6.7 billion in border wall funds, which is now the subject of ongoing litigation in several federal courts.The number of family members intercepted at the southwest border soared in March, according to preliminary CBP statistics. While overall arrests remain below the higher levels of 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s, the Trump administration argues families and children present unique humanitarian and security issues.\\nforeign policy\\n                    By ASSOCIATED PRESSNielsen last week urged Congress to provide additional resources to deal with the growing number of migrants. In addition, she pressed lawmakers to change immigration laws to permit children to be detained for more than 20 days — the current limit set by a federal court order — and to allow for the swift deportation of unaccompanied minors from Central America.The administration’s demands to Congress in recent days have gone largely unanswered as Democrats have faulted Trump for exacerbating an already-fraught humanitarian situation.

She kept a list of White House officials whose clearance applications were initially denied but eventually overruled, and said the list included as many as 25 people, some of whom had daily access to the president. Story Continued Below“According to Ms. Newbold, these individuals had a wide range of serious disqualifying issues involving foreign influence, conflicts of interest, concerning personal conduct, financial problems, drug use, and criminal conduct,” aides wrote in the 10-page memo, summarizing Newbold’s testimony.Newbold, who sat for an interview with the House Oversight and Reform Committee on March 23 about the Trump administration’s security clearance process, is the highest-ranking White House official to speak out about the issue which has come under intense scrutiny from lawmakers.She told the committee that coming to Congress was her “last hope” to bring “integrity” back to her office, noting that her internal complaints were ignored even as she amassed a list of more than two dozen officials whose clearances were approved despite an initial denial.Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politicsBy signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

She was suspended without pay for two weeks earlier this year, an action she described as retaliation and one that is under review by federal anti-discrimination officials.Newbold is still a White House employee but she is no longer allowed to adjudicate security clearances amid a wider reorganization of the personnel security office, her lawyer Ed Passman told POLITICO on Monday. She’s also in constant fear of losing her job, Passman added.“She needs the income for her healthcare and her kids. She’s very concerned,” Passman said.“I would not be doing a service to myself, my country, or my children if I sat back knowing that the issues that we have could impact national security,” Newbold added in her interview with committee staffers for the Republican and Democratic sides of the committee.The committee’s investigation into the White House security clearance process intensified earlier this year after it was reported that President Donald Trump ordered his then-chief of staff to grant a top-secret security clearance to Jared Kushner, the president’s senior adviser and son-in-law, a directive that overruled intelligence officials.\\nThe Mueller Report\\n                    By DARREN SAMUELSOHN and KYLE CHENEYRep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the committee’s chairman, has requested documents and witness interviews from the White House related specifically to Kushner’s clearance. The White House has said it would not comply with the “overly intrusive” request for information. The committee will vote to authorize a subpoena for Kline on Tuesday, Cummings said in a letter to White House Counsel Pat Cipollone in which the chairman of the powerful House committee chided the top White House lawyer over his refusal to turn over documents to the panel.“You have refused to provide any information about the specific individuals the committee is investigating, the specific instances of abuse, wrongdoing, or mistakes we have identified, or the problematic practices of the White House Security Office over the past two years,” Cummings wrote.The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), the top Republican on the Oversight panel, said Cummings was releasing “cherry-picked” information and claimed that Newbold’s list of 25 people includes “non-political officials such as a GSA custodian.”“It is extremely unfortunate and disappointing that Chairman Cummings is now using this sensitive topic as a pretense for a partisan attack on the White House,” Jordan said.In a response memo, Republicans on the Oversight Committee complained that Democrats took Newbold\\'s interview out of context and mischaracterized her knowledge of the reasons top officials overruled her security clearance decisions. They also argued that Newbold\\'s testimony was \"overblown\" because only a handful of security clearance applications she denied were for “very serious reasons.”“If Kline overturned only—at most—five clearance adjudications with very serious concerns out of five thousand, Ms. Newbold’s concerns seem overblown,” Republican aides wrote in their memo.During her interview with the committee, Newbold acknowledged the president’s right to unilaterally grant security clearances, but she said that power should be scrutinized.“Once we adjudicate it, the president absolutely has the right to override and still grant the clearance, but we owe it to the president and the American people to do what is expected of us, and our job is to adjudicate national security adjudications regardless of influence,” Newbold testified to the committee.\\ncongress\\n                    By HEATHER CAYGLE and BURGESS EVERETTThe memo noted that the White House “sought to block” Newbold and other witnesses from speaking out to lawmakers. It also said other whistleblowers have “corroborated” Newbold’s allegations, “but they were too afraid about the risk to their careers to come forward publicly.”Newbold explained that she often clashed with Kline, who was her boss. She also outlined three specific examples in which three senior White House officials — identified only as one, two and three — had their clearance denials overruled.In the case of one of those officials, Newbold said Kline dismissed concerns of “foreign influence, outside activities … and personal conduct” of that individual by simply noting in the person’s file: “The activities occurred prior to federal service.” Newbold also said a separate government agency reached out to her to understand “how we rendered a favorable adjudication” for that individual.“Ms. Newbold informed committee staff that this was an indication of the agency’s ‘serious concerns’ regarding the White House’s adjudicative outcome,” the memo states.Kline often personally intervened to override concerns about granting a clearance to certain officials, according to Newbold.In the case of another senior White House official, Newbold said she told Kline that she planned to deny that clearance application based on an “extremely thorough” 14-page memo detailing “foreign influence and outside activities.” According to Newbold, Kline granted that individual a clearance after telling Newbold to “not touch” the issue.Newbold also told the committee that Kline asked her to “change” an unfavorable recommendation for a senior National Security Council official. “I said I absolutely would not,” Newbold said.Kyle Cheney contributed to this story.Missing out on the latest scoops?

According to the attorney general, Mueller’s investigation did “not conclude that the President committed a crime” but “also does not exonerate him” — a line Democrats have seized on in their demands for the full report.Barr told lawmakers last week that a redacted version of the report could be expected around mid-April. In the meantime, several of Mueller’s high-profile defenders in Congress have not backed down from their insistence that there is evidence Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia, arguing that it’s possible such collusion would not amount to criminality or that Mueller’s narrow mandate hamstrung his inquiry. Trump claimed later Monday morning that Democrats hungry for damning information about him will never stop hunting for it. Whatever information Democrats are given on the Mueller report, Trump wrote on Twitter, \"will never be good enough.\"Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, on Monday morning announced plans to subpoena Mueller’s full report despite Barr’s assurance that the document will be released by mid-April. Barr has said some portions would be redacted.In addition, Nadler began a wide-ranging investigation into obstruction of justice allegations against Trump last month ahead of the release of Mueller’s report. “No matter what information is given to the crazed Democrats from the No Collusion Mueller Report, it will never be good enough,” Trump tweeted. “Behind closed doors the Dems are laughing!”Missing out on the latest scoops?

Nadler has said he’s “disturbed” by Barr’s reticence to share the full report immediately and has asked him to join the committee in seeking a judge’s approval to release all grand jury information in Mueller’s report.Barr is reviewing the document to scrub it of four categories of information — including grand jury information and material he deems derogatory to “peripheral third parties.” Barr has also indicated he intends to redact classified information and material relevant to ongoing investigations.Rep.

Though Mueller indicated he did not make a \"traditional prosecutorial judgment\" on obstruction after his 22-month investigation, Barr quickly issued his own last week, saying Trump could not be charged with the crime in part because there was no underlying crime to obstruct.But Nadler noted in his op-ed that numerous Trump associates were charged in the Mueller investigation — and that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who was previously a federal prosecutor in Maryland, \"routinely charged individuals with obstruction without charging the underlying crime.\" Trump, too, has been implicated — though remains uncharged — in a campaign finance-related crime that stemmed from Mueller\\'s probe as well, Nadler noted.Nadler suggested he expects Congress to craft a legislative response to the entire episode. \"Put another way: If President Trump’s behavior wasn’t criminal, then perhaps it should have been,\" he said.Democrats on the panel on Wednesday also intend to authorize subpoenas for documents from five former Trump White House officials: Former chief of staff Reince Priebus, former senior adviser Steven Bannon, former communications director Hope Hicks and former White House counsel Don McGahn, as well as McGahn’s former deputy Ann Donaldson.\\nwhite house\\n                    By GABBY ORRAll of the individuals may have materials from the White House relevant to the Mueller probe or their outside lawyers, which Democrats say waives their ability to assert protection privileges.A DOJ spokeswoman declined to comment about Nadler’s latest subpoena move.

I\\'ll have a more complete analysis later, but until then: a big thank you to all our supporters.\"The number is likely to put Buttigieg in the upper echelon of 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls as they publicize their first-quarter fundraising numbers over the next two weeks. Some of Buttigieg\\'s rivals have reported large first-day cash hauls but have yet to release first quarter estimates. Former Texas Rep. Beto O\\'Rourke raised $6.1 million in the wake of his campaign launch, while Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) raised $5.9 million on his first day as a 2020 presidential candidate. Sen. Kamala Harris of California raised $1.5 million immediately after launching her presidential campaign.Buttigieg has benefited from a few moments that went viral online and translated into bursts of donations. His performance at a CNN town hall, where he criticized Vice President Mike Pence, increased his visibility, as did a handful of early polls showing him leapfrogging other 2020 Democratic rivals. \\nConnor Farrell, a veteran Democratic finance consultant and the founder of the consulting firm Left Rising, said the question going forward will be whether Buttigieg can keep up his fundraising and use it to build a major campaign. Buttigieg’s campaign has begun looking to hire state directors in Iowa and New Hampshire and expand its campaign offices.\"I think it\\'s a really significant number,\" Farrell said Monday morning. \"I just wonder if he\\'ll be able to keep a comparative pace that allows him to do significant advertising in the early states.\"Farrell added that it\\'s likely other Democratic candidates who have already proven to be prodigious fundraisers will probably post big numbers as well. \"It\\'s really good for a small town mayor but I think Bernie and Beto are going to post 25 to 30 million dollars and the pace and the gulf there is going to widen,” Farrell said, adding: \"I think it probably takes him out of the B team and puts him at the bottom rung of the A team.\"Buttigieg’s exploratory committee is using the fundraising number to build even more hype around his campaign.

And Trump just promised to kill it.His HIV plan relies on key pieces of Obamacare to expand access to prevention and treatment services for Americans at risk of contracting the deadly virus. Expanding opioid prevention relies heavily on Medicaid, which expanded under Obamacare. And Trump’s push to lower drug prices would use an innovation program that tests drug cost modeling — and was created by Obamacare.Story Continued BelowSo while the notion of killing Obamacare altogether arouses the GOP base, the reality is that the decade-old law is so intertwined with the entire U.S. health care system that repealing large chunks of it would destroy the ability to do things Trump actually likes.Even members of Trump’s team have raised red flags. Outgoing Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said Thursday that overturning Obamacare could thwart an initiative to get cheaper forms of insulin on the market. Carl Schmid, an AIDS Institute leader and co-chair of Trump’s HIV advisory board, called the ACA decision “an unfortunate distraction from ending the HIV epidemic initiative.”“He’s just completely consigning his own initiatives to the ash heap if the ACA goes down,\" said Sara Rosenbaum, a health law and policy expert at George Washington University. “It has become the fabric of the health care system.”The race for 2020 starts now.

You can unsubscribe at any time.If the law is struck down in court, as the president is rooting for, an estimated 25 million people will lose coverage through private insurance and Medicaid expansion, and insurers would no longer be required to cover people with pre-existing conditions like HIV/AIDS. The HIV and opioid crises are intertwined because HIV infections have increased with people sharing needles for injecting drugs. Any Obamacare changes that hurt one of those efforts will have serious ramifications for the other.“Trump’s attempt to dismantle the ACA would critically undermine the goal of ending the HIV epidemic in the United States in the near term,” said Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), co-founder and co-chair of the bipartisan congressional HIV/AIDS caucus.“It would be like pulling the chair out from under the initiative,” said Jen Kates, director of Global Health and HIV Policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation. In the days before Obamacare’s guarantees of coverage despite pre-existing conditions, people with HIV seeking individual insurance were denied 100 percent of the time, she said.Advocates and lawmakers have similar concerns about the national response to the opioid crisis, which Trump declared a public health emergency in 2017. The Affordable Care Act’s expansion of Medicaid covers about 1.2 million people getting mental health and addiction treatment, according to a study published in Health Affairs.\\nhealth care\\n                    By DAN DIAMONDFinally, Trump’s plan to lower drug prices to what patients pay overseas depends on various parts of the ACA, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid’s Innovation Center — a vehicle for testing new payment models.The president last week abruptly shifted his position and signaled support for a federal judge’s ruling that the ACA in its entirety should be thrown out, despite objections from his health secretary and attorney general. Obamacare’s fate is likely to once again be settled by the Supreme Court. Trump has promised something better in its place, but no one knows what that might be.If Obamacare goes, prevention services and screening requirements provided under the ACA’s essential health benefits would be eliminated. This would occur as Obamacare was expected to soon require that PrEP, a drug that can prevent new HIV infections, be made available for free in all health insurance plans. Without those protections, fewer people could be diagnosed and get care — directly undermining a key goal of the Trump administration’s HIV strategy: to detect infections and treat people early to avoid spread of the disease. Recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show about 8 in 10 new infections are transmitted by people who don’t know they’re infected.Public health experts are deeply concerned by any potential rollback in services, particularly in Medicaid, which covers more than 40 percent of all people living with HIV, according to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation. Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion is credited with increasing coverage of people with HIV — which jumped from 36 percent in 2012 to 42 percent in 2014 and probably has grown since many more states have bolstered their Medicaid rolls.The Trump HIV plan doesn’t count on states expanding Medicaid, but “they were also not expecting a state to lose access to Medicaid expansion as a result of a court case,” said Bill McColl, AIDS United’s vice president of advocacy and policy.\\nhealth care\\n                    By RACHEL ROUBEIN and ALICE MIRANDA OLLSTEINTo make its HIV plan work, the Trump administration planned to rely on nonprofit health clinics and hospitals that receive steep discounts on drugs. Obamacare expanded this program, known as 340B, to rural, critical access and community hospitals. That drug savings money is credited with keeping many of these facilities open and alleviating some of the burden on health centers that treat uninsured and low-income HIV patients.If financially strapped rural hospitals lose their 340B status due to the elimination of Obamacare, it would place a huge burden on other places that treat HIV patients, like the Ryan White Clinics, said Peggy Tighe, the lead lobbyist for Ryan White Clinics for 340B Access. The cuts to 340B would also hurt anti-addiction treatment because some of the patients treated for HIV infections in rural hospitals and clinics are also opioid users, Tighe said.More than 170 hospitals were added to the drug discount program thanks to Obamacare in the seven states the Trump administration\\'s HIV plan targets, according to the Health Resources and Services Administration. About 1,000 rural hospitals throughout the country joined the program, according to 340B Health, which lobbies for these health care facilities.By eliminating Medicaid expansion, reversing the ACA would make Trump’s plan to eliminate HIV vastly more expensive, “although still a worthy goal,” Schmid said.The billions Congress has appropriated to expand opioid treatment services would be undermined without the health care law’s coverage and consumer protections, such as the requirement that insurers cover addiction care the same way they cover other medical services.“You cannot strengthen a response to these problems if your foundation is weak,” said Andrew Kessler, founder and principal at Slingshot Solutions.When it comes to drug prices, ending Obamacare immediately would raise costs for seniors and state governments, while other Americans might see their drug coverage disappear entirely thanks to the loss of the ACA’s mandate that all health plans cover prescription medications. \\nHealth Care \\n                    By RACHANA PRADHANSeniors would likely spend about $2,000 or more in out-of-pocket drug costs each year without Obamacare, estimates Juliette Cubanski, Kaiser Family Foundation’s associate director of Medicare policy. That’s because the ACA requires drugmakers to provide big discounts to seniors in the coverage gap phase of Medicare Part D. And states would no longer be entitled to the larger discounts on drugs provided to Medicaid programs under Obamacare.Meanwhile, Trump administration efforts to get cheaper medicines to market could falter. Obamacare created the biosimilar pathway, a way for companies to bring more affordable versions of some of the most costly and complex biologic medicines to market.Eliminating the biosimilar pathway could cripple efforts to get more affordable versions of insulin to patients. Starting in 2020, insulin will be regulated as a biologic, finally giving companies seeking to make cheaper copycats a way to get a product approved that could be automatically substituted for branded insulin, whose cost has been rising.Gottlieb, who as FDA chief has made biosimilars a priority, acknowledged at a Senate Appropriations hearing Thursday that if Obamacare is overturned it would thwart FDA’s plan to increase access to them.“It’s a very important pathway and we fully support it, obviously,” Gottlieb said in response to questions from Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont). “We think it has been profoundly impactful with consumers.”Other Trump plans to lower the cost of medicines also would be stymied, like the president’s idea to test aligning Medicare payments for pricey doctor-administered drugs to the lower costs paid by other wealthy nations.This and other similar demonstrations can’t be done without Obamacare\\'s Innovation Center, which gives the government broad powers to test new health policies without congressional approval.Missing out on the latest scoops?

It’s not all bad for Democrats, who can help lay the groundwork for Democrats’ 2020 agenda and show voters what the party can do if it sweeps into power in the next election.But it’s the latest reality check for House Democrats, who assumed power amid the longest government shutdown in history and saw their agenda frozen for weeks until a deadlock over Trump’s border wall was resolved.When Pelosi and her deputies were finally able to turn to their big-ticket items, including passing a guns background checks bill and a sprawling anti-corruption package, they were overshadowed by caucus infighting and procedural stumbles.Now Democrats — particularly the 60-plus freshmen — are encountering a new reality: It doesn’t matter what they do as long as Republicans control both the Senate and the White House.“Right now, we are not doing anything — House and the Senate combined,” said freshman Rep. Max Rose (D-N.Y.). “I am frustrated that Mitch McConnell is a coward. Unwilling, unable to put legislation on the floor.”\\nhealth care\\n                    By DAN DIAMONDSenate Democrats know this dynamic all too well, having seen McConnell stifle President Barack Obama’s agenda, not to mention his Supreme Court nominee in 2016.“He’s going to give it the Merrick Garland treatment,” said Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) of House Democrats’ agenda.McConnell isn’t entirely unwilling to put liberal proposals on the floor, at least when he senses a political benefit. With the Democrats’ divided over the Green New Deal, McConnell put the measure up for a vote last week only to see 43 Democrats vote present — an awkward result for a blueprint endorsed by many Senate Democrats running for president.Senate Republicans could also push for votes on “Medicare for All” or keeping the Supreme Court at nine justices to try and divide Democrats. Democrats say privately that the strategy of voting present is now viewed as the best way to deal with “gotcha” votes from McConnell.But when it comes to the sweeping ethics and election reforms of HR 1 or other major progressive proposals, Democrats’ have little hope of getting Senate Republicans even on the record. That leaves relatively small-bore legislation as perhaps the only option for success in divided government, but there hasn’t been much focus on infrastructure improvements or other bipartisan ideas in either chamber.Pelosi aides argue public pressure could force McConnell to act on bills passed by the House.“Public support for the For The People agenda was critical to our victory in November and it will be key to removing any obstacle in our way, including a Republican Senate,” said Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill.Some House Democrats’ frustration is focused not on McConnell but within their own caucus.“It’s time to move off the talking points and on to legislating,” said Rep. Kurt Schrader (D-Ore.), a moderate Democrat who hasn’t been shy about criticizing his party’s leadership. “I haven’t heard about anything that deals with the economy or some of the other issues.”Schrader noted he and other members of the center-left Blue Dog Coalition sent a letter to Pelosi and Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) in January, urging them to prioritize passing a transportation bill.“I assume this is just playing to the left wing of our base and that we’ll move on to the infrastructure, prescription drugs,” Schrader added of the current agenda. Other moderates are also hopeful leadership will soon move past what they see as pie-in-the-sky messaging bills.“I wouldn’t call it frustration. I would call it anticipation,” said Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.). “I’m very hopeful that on both transportation and infrastructure, and on health care costs, we might be moving into that phase.”\\nnational emergency\\n                    By MELANIE ZANONA House Democrats have held multiple hearings on infrastructure and prescription drugs, a precursor, aides argue, to bringing legislation to the floor later this year.Pelosi’s staff is in the early stages of talks with the White House and senior Senate Republicans on a potential prescription drug package. But even infrastructure — an idea that at its broadest unites Democrats, Republicans and Trump — comes with its own hurdles.House Democrats are expected to pivot to their infrastructure package in late spring or early summer. But, as in past years, finding a long-term solution for highway and other transit investments will be difficult. Lawmakers have resisted raising the gas tax for 25 years.In the meantime, House Democrats are about to see a repeat dynamic from eight years ago, when emboldened Republicans took the House majority and sent then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) dozens of conservative bills. Reid let virtually all of them languish.“When you’re in the House, you’re consumed” with your agenda, said Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.), a former House member. Then “you look at the papers ... and you go: \\'No one’s talking about what we’re working on.\\' Because everyone knows it’s not going anywhere.”Perhaps the best result for Democrats would be that inaction on their legislation puts pressure on GOP Sens. Cory Gardner of Colorado, Susan Collins of Maine or Martha McSally of Arizona to break with McConnell and demand votes on campaign-finance reform or environmental bills. While a long shot, that would at least make the point that even if Democrats beat Trump, they need to capture the Senate as well.“If all they do under McConnell’s leadership is block everything in a presidential turnout year, I think they really risk losing some of their seats like Maine, like Colorado, like Arizona,” said Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.). “If they want to keep control of the U.S. Senate, they better deliver something.”Andrew Desiderio and Sarah Ferris contributed to this report.Missing out on the latest scoops?

His task now is to convert it into a full-fledged campaign.\\n                    By ELENA SCHNEIDER04/01/2019 05:00 AM EDT\\n                    Updated 04/01/2019 07:10 AM EDTPete Buttigieg has the mojo. Now he needs a campaign. The South Bend, Ind., mayor is earning glowing news coverage and enjoying a polling spike after a fiery rebuke of Vice President Mike Pence during a CNN town hall. But, so far, he’s got almost no on-the-ground operation in the early states, as he has to figure out how to convert his Twitter-trending bid into a sustained national campaign.Story Continued Below“Up to now, I haven’t seen or heard of anything he’s built here in Iowa,” said Jerry Crawford, a longtime Iowa Democratic operative. Buttigieg \"hasn’t had the resources to build it yet, so now all this buzz, this boomlet he’s having can give him the finances to do it, but he’s still several stages behind everyone else.”The challenge for Buttigieg goes beyond teaching America how to pronounce his last name. Local operatives said the 37-year-old lags in the sprawling pack of 2020 candidates in building infrastructure in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina — a problem that Buttigieg’s campaign is trying to correct quickly as money starts rolling in. More like gushing in: The campaign announced Monday it raised more than $7 million in the first three months of the year, a staggering figure for a small-city mayor who was virtually unknown nationally starting the race. \"We (you) are out-performing expectations at every turn,\" Buttigieg tweeted.Crawford also warned that the “best talent” in Iowa and New Hampshire has already been snapped up by his 2020 rivals.“Earned media can take you far, but a presidential campaign starts in Iowa,” said John Lapp, a Democratic strategist with deep experience in national politics.

It\\'s also recruiting state staffers in Iowa and New Hampshire, as well as courting consulting firms. But Lis Smith, the campaign spokeswoman, said it “won’t be [a] consultant-heavy\" team.On Monday, the Buttigieg campaign will move into its new headquarters, in an office building in downtown South Bend, that features the mayor\\'s name in 2-foot tall letters painted on the wall: \"BOOT EDGE EDGE.\" Buttigieg told POLITICO that the “response has been tremendous since we arrived in a bigger way than before on the national scene, and I’m confident that’s going to bring us the resources we need to mount a credible effort.”It’s a critical juncture for Buttigieg, and strategists warned that he needs to quickly scale up from a Twitter darling to a serious contender. The spotlight is hot: In the past month, Buttigieg appeared on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” HBO’s “Real Time with Bill Maher” and Power 105.1’s “The Breakfast Club.” His book, \"Shortest Way Home\" jumped back onto the New York Times\\' bestseller list this week. His husband, Chasten Buttigieg, earned column write-ups on his Twitter personality by Elle and POLITICO, as well as coveted Twitter follows by Chrissy Teigen and Lin-Manuel Miranda.\\n2020 elections\\n                    By CARLA MARINUCCIButtigieg was invited to appear on Ellen DeGeneres’ daytime talk show, the same stage that launched his 2020 rival, then-Texas Senate candidate Beto O’Rourke, into the fundraising stratosphere in 2018. The episode is scheduled to air on April 11.“It’s the quintessential 2019 way of campaigning,” said Dan Sena, a Democratic strategist who led the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee last election cycle. “But the big, big, big, big question is: Does all of this translate into people actually voting for you? The biggest pitfall for him would be it just doesn’t translate from social media to the electorate.”But while several Republicans running in recent presidential primaries benefited from a surge of media attention, they eventually stalled out — Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina in 2016, Herman Cain in 2012. And some strategists remain skeptical that Buttigieg will avoid their fate.“If Twitter candidates were always going to win, Cynthia Nixon would be the governor of New York right now,” said Jess Morales Rocketto, a Democratic strategist who worked on Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign. “Twitter is not voters, and it doesn’t always translate, especially with voters in Iowa and New Hampshire.”Yet there are early signs of Buttigieg support manifesting beyond the social media bubble. After the CNN town hall, he raised more than $600,000 and announced he’d reached the DNC’s threshold to make the debate stage in June.In a follow-up fundraising email pitch in mid-March, the Buttigieg campaign asked donors to give $500,000 before March 31, the cutoff for the first fundraising quarter. He received that much by the day\\'s end. The campaign made the same ask a second time — another $500,000 before the filing deadline — and, again, it pulled in that amount in one day. Buttigieg said he’s “surprised by the pace” of the attention he’s received since it “happened so suddenly after the CNN town hall.” It has shaped the way his campaign will move forward, he said.“It goes to show: It makes a difference when you get in front of a lot more people, and that’s going to be our objective in the weeks and months to come, to get in front of as many people as possible,” he said.\\n2020 \\n                    By JOANNA WEISSHis appeal isn’t limited to the small-dollar donors who poured in after the CNN town hall. Susie Tompkins Buell, a Democratic megadonor, will throw a fundraiser for Buttigieg, even though she’s said she supports California Sen. Kamala Harris in the primary.John Atkinson, who served on President Barack Obama’s national finance committee in 2008 and 2012, said “there are a lot of people within Obamaworld that are starting to coalesce around him.”“I’ve been around a long time, and I know what a moment is and this is not a moment,” said Atkinson, who is planning to host a fundraiser for Buttigieg in Chicago next month. “This is the real deal.”Buttigieg is also creeping up in national and Iowa polling, jumping up to 4 percent nationally in the Quinnipiac University poll released this week. Another poll released this week by Focus On Rural America, a progressive group, showed Buttigieg going “from an asterisk, so basically zero, to 6 percent, which is solidly in the second tier of presidential candidates” and “not an easy feat to accomplish,” said Jeff Link, an Iowa-based Democratic consultant who advises the group.In the long slog of a primary, the “physical infrastructure, men and women knocking on doors for you here” can’t be underestimated, Columbia, S.C., Mayor Steve Benjamin warned — even if Buttigieg’s “Twitter game is on fire.”“I’ve not met any of his staff on the ground here, but I do know he’s talking to folks,” said Benjamin, who served as Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman in the state in 2016. “It would behoove Pete, as well as other candidates, to lock down staff fast.”Carla Marinucci contributed to this report.

(Nixon, an avid pipe smoker, indulged in as many as eight bowls a day.) Tobacco companies were the single largest product advertisers on television in 1969. They continue to advertise to this day on print media, billboards and through other legal means. (The last televised cigarette ad ran on Jan. 1, 1971 at 11:50 p.m. during NBC’s “Johnny Carson Show.”)As early as 1939, medical studies linked cigarette smoking to higher rates of cancer and heart disease. In the 1950s, all 48 states banned the sale of cigarettes to minors. In 1964, the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Communications Commission decreed that advertisers needed to warn the public of the dangers of smoking. In 1969, after the U.S. surgeon general released a report linking cigarette smoking to low birth weight, Congress passed the Cigarette Smoking Act, requiring cigarette manufacturers to issue warning labels on each pack that they sold which stated: “Cigarette Smoking May be Hazardous to Your Health.”Story Continued BelowSmoking has been a major fixture on the American scene since the nation’s founding. Presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and Andrew Jackson owned tobacco plantations and either used tobacco as snuff or else smoked cigars. Tobacco excise taxes were inaugurated during Washington’s presidency and continue to this day.In 1962, John F. Kennedy became the first president to sponsor studies on smoking and public health. (JFK smoked Cuban-made cigars.)Presidential cigarette smokers included William Howard Taft (who quit during his single term), Warren Harding, Franklin D. Roosevelt (who was photographed with his jaunty black cigarette holder), Herbert Hoover (a chain smoker) and Dwight D. Eisenhower. John Adams, Calvin Coolidge and Gerald R. Ford and Nixon smoked pipes. Presidents Ulysses S. Grant, Teddy Roosevelt, Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton would sometimes light an after-dinner cigar at state functions. By contrast, Presidents Harry S. Truman, Rutherford B. Hayes and first lady Hilary Clinton banned smoking while they lived at the White House.Your guide to the media circus — weekday mornings, in your inbox.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

The legislation banned the use of vending machines and product sampling (except in adult-only facilities), and it restricted the sale of tobacco in retail establishments to face-to-face transactions between retailers and consumers.During World War II, about half of adult Americans were regular smokers. According to data collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, by 2017 cigarette smoking had fallen to its lowest point in recorded history. An estimated 14 percent of American adults., or 34.3 million people, smoked cigarettes, down from15.5 percent in 2016. In households with annual incomes of $100,000 or more, less than 8 in 100 individuals now smoke.SOURCE: WWW.HISTORY.COMMissing out on the latest scoops?

Story Continued BelowThe scene is not dissimilar from the one Lucy Flores alleges took place at a Las Vegas rally five years ago, when she says Biden leaned in to smell her hair and plant an “awkward kiss” on the back of her head. Flores was then Nevada’s Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor.Those claims, made by Flores in an essay published Friday in The Cut, have roiled Biden’s prospective 2020 presidential candidacy and raised new concerns among Democrats regarding his often touchy-feely interactions with voters and government officials across a half-century of public service — evincing fresh doubts about Biden’s political viability in the era of #MeToo.But in a blog post published Sunday on Medium, Carter wrote that Biden’s display of affection toward her in 2015 was appreciated, as she was “uncharacteristically nervous” after slipping on some ice upon her arrival at the Pentagon earlier in the day. \\n2020 Elections\\n                    By MARC CAPUTO“After the swearing-in, as Ash was giving remarks, he leaned in to tell me ‘thank you for letting him do this’ and kept his hands on my shoulders as a means of offering his support,” Carter wrote. “But a still shot taken from a video — misleadingly extracted from what was a longer moment between close friends — sent out in a snarky tweet — came to be the lasting image of that day.”Carter wrote that she and her husband had previously known Biden and his wife, Jill, “for many years, long before he had become vice president,” and revealed that she expressed her condolences to the couple about the media’s coverage of the incident. “I told them I felt awful that after he had generously taken time out of his day to swear in an old friend, his attempt to support me had become a joke and even more — supposed proof positive that he didn’t understand how to respect women,” Carter wrote. “I thought it would all blow over if I didn’t dignify it with a response. But clearly that was wishful thinking.”Carter also wrote that while she does not know Flores, she supports “her right to speak her truth,” adding that Flores and “all women” should be believed.“But her story is not mine. The Joe Biden in my picture is a close friend helping someone get through a big day, for which I will always be grateful,” Carter wrote. “So, as the sole owner of my story, it is high time that I reclaim it — from strangers, Twitter, the pundits and the late-night hosts.”Missing out on the latest scoops?

Her friends and political allies in Nevada were talking to Biden and his associates about his potential bid this month. And the pictures and video clips of Biden hugging women, caressing their hair and holding on to their shoulders in too-familiar ways began surfacing on social media.“When I started to see pictures of him behaving in the same way he did with me and with other women, it was very triggering,” she said. “I felt so much empathy for them.

And that’s never a good thing,” she said. “It makes the conversation a little more difficult because then you are getting into the, ‘Well, it’s not as bad. It’s bad but it’s not that bad.’ Or you force people to say, ‘That’s not bad at all.’ And I’m saying yes it is. It is bad.”Biden’s camp did not reply to the particulars of Flores’ new statements, but it did point to a new Medium post from Stephanie Carter, the wife of former Defense Secretary Ash Carter, who said a picture of Biden holding her by her shoulders at an event was innocent and that he “kept his hands on my shoulders as a means of offering his support.”Previously, Biden\\'s aides have issued two carefully worded statements about Flores\\' accusations.The latter, released before the Sunday TV political shows, asserted that he “offered countless handshakes, hugs, expressions of affection, support and comfort. And not once — never — did I believe I acted inappropriately. If it is suggested I did so, I will listen respectfully. But it was never my intention.“I may not recall these moments the same way, and I may be surprised at what I hear,” he added. “But we have arrived at an important time when women feel they can and should relate their experiences, and men should pay attention. And I will.”\\n2020 Elections\\n                    By MARC CAPUTO and MARTIN MATISHAKA slew of Democratic candidates for president said they believed Flores, while allies of Biden tried to discredit her.Flores said Biden’s second statement was better than the first, but “by him saying that never ever did he believe his behavior was inappropriate is still a big problem because it’s really hard for me to believe that after so many years of the same type of behavior and so many pictures and so many videos that someone didn’t at some point didn’t say to him, ‘You should stop behaving this way.’”Biden has not called Flores to discuss the matter, and she said she doesn’t expect him to.Biden has sounded contrite before without following up. In 2017, he said he owed an apology to Anita Hill for the way he, as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1991, handled her sexual harassment accusations against then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas. But as of 2018, Hill told Elle magazine, Biden hadn’t called her.“‘He said, ‘I owe her an apology.’ People were asking, ‘When are you going to apologize to her?’”’ Hill told the publication. “It’s become sort of a running joke in the household when someone rings the doorbell and we’re not expecting company. ‘Oh,’ we say, ‘Is that Joe Biden coming to apologize?’”Biden last week offered another public apology to Hill and expressed regret about the way her hearing was handled. But Flores said that statement, too, lacked substance.“His recent comment of him saying he wishes he could have done more is so lacking in responsibility,” she said. “To suggest that, as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee that he could not have done more, is just false.”Flores said she knew Biden\\'s allies would attack her after she came forward, but she\\'s also been encouraged by the support she\\'s received, too.“We’re talking about invasion of your bodily space, of your privacy, agency over your own body and who gets to touch it and how we ought to feel around very, very powerful men and how those powerful men should behave,” she said. “This is not new, this is something that we have known for a very long time. And it was just never addressed with the seriousness that it deserves. I feel like that’s progress.”Missing out on the latest scoops?

Rep. Joaquín Castro (D-Texas), chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, called the move “short-sighted and flawed,” and cautioned that it could inflame what he called a humanitarian crisis at the border. Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), vice chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said it was “foreign policy by tweet” and demonstrated Trump’s ignorance of the funds\\' purpose.Story Continued BelowSeveral House Democrats were visiting El Salvador when they heard the news.

Trump warned Friday that he would close all legal trade and travel along the southwest border in the coming week unless Mexico steps up enforcement against migrants.But critics point out that the aid the president will cut is aimed squarely at reducing illegal immigration and illicit trafficking by addressing the dire conditions in the three Northern Triangle region that are driving the northern migration.Get the latest on employment and immigration, every weekday morning — in your inbox.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

But the president\\'s latest pronouncement, made during a visit to Florida on Friday, was accompanied by action from the State Department.“I\\'ve ended payments to Guatemala, to Honduras and to El Salvador,” Trump said Friday. “We were paying them tremendous amounts of money, and we\\'re not paying them anymore because they haven\\'t done a thing for us.”The aid money — part of an initiative launched by former President Barack Obama — aims to strengthen security and foster development in the three countries, and does not go to the governments directly. The State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development manage the bulk of the funds, and other agencies, including the departments of Justice and Homeland Security, also receive funding.POLITICO reported last week that the White House budget office had not advanced a significant portion of the fiscal year 2018 funding amid confusion over Trump’s stance. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo dodged questions about the funds\\' status during a House committee hearing Wednesday.Following Trump’s announcement, the State Department informed several congressional offices Friday that $450 million in uncommitted funds from a March 2018 spending bill will be redirected to other initiatives and that the department will review already-committed funds from fiscal years 2017 and 2018 to determine whether they can be rerouted to other projects.“At the secretary’s instruction, we are carrying out the president’s direction and ending FY 2017 and FY 2018 foreign assistance programs for the Northern Triangle,” a State Department spokeswoman told POLITICO. “We will be engaging Congress as part of this process.”\\nforeign policy\\n                    By ASSOCIATED PRESSWhether the president can reroute the funding entirely remains unclear, according to three congressional aides familiar with how the process works. A reprogramming request could be held up by lawmakers who oppose the move, for example. Additionally, the administration could face legal challenges if it revokes funds that were already contracted. And backers of the aid may argue that withholding it amounts to illegal presidential impoundment of congressionally-appropriated funds.Leahy’s office, which takes a lead role overseeing the funding, has directed the State Department to provide a detailed explanation of what it plans to cut and whether there will be exceptions. The department will be required to submit a congressional notification that describes the plan to lawmakers.One Democratic congressional aide said State was “clearly scrambling to adjust U.S. policy based on [Trump‘s] comments.”Central American officials publicly grappled with Trump’s decision, which came mere days after DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen traveled to Honduras to sign a security agreement with the three Northern Triangle nations to crack down on human trafficking, among other goals.The office of the Honduran secretary for foreign affairs said in a statement Saturday that it will continue to promote regional development and security despite “contradictory policies” from the United States. Nayib Bukele, the president-elect of El Salvador, tweeted that he hopes the U.S. will reinstate or increase the funding when he takes office June 1.Adriana Beltrán, a director with the Washington Office on Latin America, a non-governmental organization that tracks the funding, argued that the cut will worsen conditions in the countries — and potentially cause more people to trek to the U.S.“It’s a shooting-yourself-in-the-foot policy,” she said of the cuts.Missing out on the latest scoops?

The violence has heightened tensions just over a week before Israeli national elections.Story Continued BelowIn a sign that Egyptian efforts have made progress, the Gaza fishermen’s committee said Israel would be extending the permitted fishing zone along the Mediterranean coast to a maximum of 15 nautical miles, up from the previous limit of nine nautical miles. Fishing had been off-limits since Gaza militants launched a rocket toward Tel Aviv last week, touching off rounds of short but intense cross-border fighting between the bitter enemies.Israeli officials confirmed that the reopening of the fishing zone would go into effect Monday.The lifting of some restrictions on the passage of people and cargo in and out of Gaza further indicated a strengthening of the cease-fire, which Hamas officials say would see Israel easing its blockade in exchange for guarantees of quiet.\\n2020 Elections\\n                    By MARC CAPUTO and MARTIN MATISHAKIsraeli and Hamas officials confirmed that the Erez and Kerem Shalom border crossings were re-opened, in a very restricted fashion, for the first time since violence flared up last Monday.The first steps toward the restoration of calm were nonetheless punctuated by exchanges of fire along the border. Just hours after Israel announced the re-opening of its main Gaza crossings Sunday, a mortar shell was launched from the Gaza Strip toward Israel, the army said.The projectile did not cross into Israeli territory but did set off air-raid sirens in the country’s south.There was no immediate claim of responsibility, and no immediate Israeli response.Earlier Sunday, Palestinian militants launched rockets into Israel during the night, and the military responded with tank fire.Four Palestinians, including three teenagers, were killed by Israeli fire on Saturday as tens of thousands of people took part in mass rallies that marked the first anniversary of demonstrations along the Israel-Gaza perimeter fence.Dozens of activists approached the fence during Saturday’s demonstration, hurling stones and explosives toward Israeli forces.Israel says it is defending its border but has come under heavy international criticism for the large number of unarmed Palestinian demonstrators who have been shot over the past 12 months.Nearly 200 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire, while one Israeli soldier was killed last summer by a Palestinian sniper in Gaza.Missing out on the latest scoops?

And that’s not easy, what she just did on TV.”In her CNN appearance, Flores amplified her earlier comments.\\n                            Lucy Flores, a candidate to be Nevada’s lieutenant governor, waves as she takes the stage to speak at a campaign event Oct. 28, 2014, in Las Vegas.   | John Locher/AP Photo“It was shocking because you don’t expect that kind of intimate behavior, you don’t expect that kind of intimacy from someone so powerful and someone who you just have no relationship [with] whatsoever — to touch you and to feel you, and to be so close you in that way,” she said.“I want him to change his behavior,” Flores told Tapper. “And I want him to acknowledge that it was wrong.”Flores, who served in Nevada’s State Assembly from 2011 to 2015, said she wanted there to be a “bigger discussion” about how there is no “accountability structure” in the political system for women to address inappropriate behavior or “more serious” instances of sexual assault.“There needs to be a conversation about powerful men feeling that they have the right to invade a woman’s space whenever they like,” she said.Biden’s Sunday statement — in which he promised to “remain the strongest advocate I can be for the rights of women” — steered clear of accusing Flores of lying but stressed that in his four decades of public service, he had “offered countless handshakes, hugs, expressions of affection, support and comfort.\"\"And not once — never — did I believe I acted inappropriately. If it is suggested I did so, I will listen respectfully. But it was never my intention.“I may not recall these moments the same way, and I may be surprised at what I hear,” he said. “But we have arrived at an important time when women feel they can and should relate their experiences, and men should pay attention. And I will.”Flores told Tapper that she thought Biden’s statement was an improvement over his earlier response to her allegations.“Well, I certainly think that [the statement] is better than his first statement that they released on Saturday,” she said. “I’m glad that he’s willing to listen. I’m glad that he is clarifying his intentions. Frankly, my point was never about his intentions. And they shouldn’t be about his intentions. It should be about the women on the receiving end of that behavior. And this isn’t the first time and it wasn’t the only incident where he was acting inappropriately with women.”Two other 2020 Democratic candidates came out in support of Flores even before her television appearance and Biden’s statement.Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said on Saturday that “Joe Biden needs to give an answer.” And former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro told reporters: “I believe Lucy Flores. We need to live in a nation where people can share their truth.”\\n2020 elections\\n                    By MARC CAPUTOThe issue of Biden’s physical contact with women, which has been commented on for years, takes on new light as he decides whether to run for the presidency for the third time in his life but the first time in the #MeToo era. He has faced renewed scrutiny of his handling of Clarence Thomas\\' 1991 Supreme Court confirmation hearing, in which Anita Hill accused the future justice of sexual misconduct.Biden’s relatively slow response to Flores highlighted the criticisms from fellow Democrats who have said that neither he nor his advisers appear ready to handle the crush of a modern campaign and the issues that go with it. And the response by some of his allies and supporters who have questioned Flores’ motives recalls a similar reaction by some Democrats earlier this year to allegations that Virginia’s lieutenant governor, Justin Fairfax, sexually assaulted two women. While Fairfax denied the charges, the Democratic mantra to “believe the woman” was relatively muted when compared to the way in which many rallied against Brett Kavanaugh during his Supreme Court confirmation hearings last year.On Saturday, Flores was under such pressure that she went on Twitter to defend herself from accusations that she was merely a supporter of Sanders’ presidential bid. She then explained further on CNN on Sunday.“The reason why we’re having these conversations about Vice President Joe Biden is because he’s considering running for president,” Flores said. “And, frankly, the reason why I felt so compelled to finally say something was because, over the years, as this behavior was documented, as it was, frankly, dismissed by the media.”She added: “What I am saying is that it’s completely inappropriate, that it does not belong in any kind of a professional setting, much less in politics. And that is something that we should consider when we are talking about the background of a person who is considering running for president.”Quint Forgey and David Cohen contributed to this article.Missing out on the latest scoops?

But as I’ve gotten older, I’ve been fortunate to go to some incredible places, and I’ve learned a lot on these trips.

Roosevelt had taken office as the nation’s 32nd president in the midst of the Great Depression, a Democratic-controlled Congress passed a sweeping jobs program to usher in the New Deal.Under the Reforestation Relief Act, the administration created the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). In short order, the program put some 250,000 men between the ages of 18 and 25 to work. The minimum enlistment period was six months. Women were excluded.Story Continued BelowIn addition to younger men, the CCC also enrolled some World War I Army veterans, skilled foresters and craftsmen, as well as about 88,000 Native Americans living on Indian reservations. Although Congress outlawed racial discrimination in the program, African-American enrollees worked in separate camps. (At the time, the courts didn’t view state-sponsored segregation as evidence of bias.) Widely regarded as one of FDR’s most successful New Deal programs, the CCC during its nine years of existence helped shape today’s national and state park systems by planting more than 3 billion trees and building trails and shelters in more than 800 parks. The U.S. Army solved an early logistical problem: Most of the newly employed young men lived along the East Coast, while much of the conservation work that needed to be done was in the West. The Army set up work camps around the country, eventually transporting millions of enrollees to those locations. By July 1, 1933, in one of the most efficient peacetime mobilization efforts in American history, 1,433 work camps had been established and more than 300,000 young men put to work.Get the latest on employment and immigration, every weekday morning — in your inbox.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Additionally, they built wildlife refuges, fish-raising centers, water storage basins, animal shelters, bridges and camp grounds facilities.CCC enrollment peaked in August 1935. At the time, more than 500,000 corpsmen were spread across some 2,900 camps. At one point or another, nearly 3 million men — about 5 percent of the total U.S. male population — took part in the program.While the CCC enjoyed strong public support throughout its tenure, the agency’s programs initially drew the ire of organized labor, a key component of the coalition that had put FDR into office. Trade unions opposed the training of unskilled workers when many union members were idled. They also opposed the Army’s involvement in the CCC, which they feared could lead to regimentation of labor.By 1941, when the program ended, Washington had turned its attention toward the need to expand the Armed Forces with both enlistees and draftees while ramping up defense spending to meet the threats posed by World War II.

Joni Ernst will have to outrun the president, whose trade war has damaged his standing in the state.\\n                    By MARIANNE LEVINE03/31/2019 06:57 AM EDTADEL, Iowa — Joni Ernst had barely kicked off a town hall one recent morning  when the barrage of complaints about Donald Trump began.One after one, constituents grilled the first-term Republican senator about the president — his attacks on John McCain, his emergency declaration at the border and why Ernst hasn’t stood up to him more often.Story Continued Below“Other senators are speaking up, criticizing Trump and defending McCain, but I have yet to hear one word from you,” one man implored her. “Is there no line Trump can cross that would cause you to break ranks with him?”Ernst kept her cool as she answered the 30 people who trekked to a high school auditorium on the outskirts of Des Moines to hear her. But she was emphatic: “Oh, I break ranks with President Trump quite a bit.” After defending McCain, she said, “So right there — there you have it.”Ernst better get used to it. At the same time she\\'s gearing for reelection, Democratic presidential candidates are camped out in Iowa, hammering Trump at every turn. The heightened attention on the president will test the political agility of Ernst, who has generally earned high marks in the state but is having to answer for Trump — whose poll numbers lag behind hers — and some of his unpopular policies.The race for 2020 starts now.

The 48-year-old combat veteran ran as an independent-minded Republican who would slash federal spending and combat Democratic overreach. But next year she’ll be on the ballot with Trump, whose tariffs have hurt the state’s agriculture industry and whose tax cut — backed by Ernst — has ballooned, not reined in, the deficit.Ernst, known in the Senate for her easy-going demeanor and willingness to work with Democrats, is favored to hang on. Her race is a top priority for Senate Republicans, not just because they’re clinging to a narrow majority heading into 2020 but because Ernst is one of the few women in their ranks — and one of their most promising prospects overall. In November, she was the first woman elected to Senate GOP leadership in eight years, and she’s one of two Republican women on the Senate’s powerful Judiciary Committee, which until this year had no GOP women.But her reelection in the conservative-leaning state, which Trump carried easily in 2016, is not a foregone conclusion. Democrats flipped two GOP-held seats in Iowa last year, and Trump\\'s approval ratings have sunk as his trade wars have stretched on. Barack Obama won the state twice and Ernst’s predecessor, Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin, represented the state for three decades.“There’s only two ways to run: One is unopposed and the other is scared. So, she’s got to be prepared and I think she will be,” said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas). Iowa, he added, “is not a ruby-red state.”Ernst projects a warm and down-to-earth demeanor: When confronted by voters, she\\'s calm and allows them to finish their thoughts. She responds by explaining her perspective and refers to voters by their first names, as if she were talking to friends.\\n2020 elections\\n                    By DAVID SIDERSDuring her first term, she’s focused on issues affecting veterans and women, pairing with Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) on a bill to require sexual assault prevention training for new members of the military and teaming with Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) on reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. She’s also known in the Senate for her monthly \"Squeal Award,\" which she uses to highlight federal spending she believes is wasteful.“I like Joni. I like working with her,” said Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), one of the most progressive members of the Democratic Party and who sits on the Armed Services Committee with Ernst. “We do have our differences, [but] I think she’s thoughtful and she’s focused on the things that she cares about.”Ernst’s poll numbers in Iowa have fluctuated but appear strong. In February, she had a 57 percent approval rating, according to a Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll, an increase over her 47 percent approval rating in September. Her approval rating has hovered around 50 percent the past two years, according to that poll.\\n                            Sen.-elect Joni Ernst speaks to supporters during an election night rally Nov. 4, 2014, in West Des Moines, Iowa. She defeated Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley for an open seat. | Charlie Neibergall/AP PhotoTrump, on the other hand, has seen his net approval rating plummet by 20 points in Iowa since he took office, according to Morning Consult. The February poll from the Des Moines Register found that 50 percent of Iowa voters disapproved of Trump, while 46 percent approved.Ernst has been a reliable vote for most of Trump\\'s agenda. She’s backed his judicial and executive branch nominees, the GOP tax cut and repeal of the Affordable Care Act. More recently, she sided with the president on his declaration of a national emergency aimed at securing funding for a southern border wall, even as a dozen other Republicans opposed the move.Ernst has broken with Trump on some issues, though. She opposed the administration’s ban on transgender people serving in the military and criticized his trade policies and the effect they\\'re having on farmers. She also supported an amendment this year opposing Trump\\'s proposed “precipitous withdrawal” of troops from Syria and Afghanistan.Former Democratic Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack, who said recently he wouldn\\'t run against Ernst, thinks Democrats should make the race a referendum on whether Ernst delivered on her promise to shake up Washington.“She has essentially been an enabler of many of the Trump policies that aren’t particularly good for Iowa,” Vilsack said in an interview.Democrat Rob Sand, who was recently elected state auditor and is seen as a potential challenger to Ernst, said her allegiance to the party line is her biggest vulnerability.\"She sold herself as this Harley-wearing, gun-shooting, pig-castrating person who really would stand up and be tough and she hasn’t been tough,” Sand said, referring to Ernst\\'s viral 2014 ad boasting about her history castrating pigs as a metaphor for how she\\'d cut government waste. “She’s just taking orders from Mitch McConnell.”Trump’s trade war with China is a huge issue in Iowa. The tariffs have slammed the state\\'s soybean industry, a big part of Iowa’s economy. Iowa State University last year projected the tariffs could cost the state’s farmers up to $2.2 billion in revenue.Ernst points to trade as an area where she\\'s disagreed with Trump. She was among a group of senators who co-sponsored legislation in February that would require the Defense Department to justify tariffs issued on national security grounds.“What he’s doing with the tariffs has been really hard on our agricultural industry and so I’m continually pushing on the administration — \\'Let’s focus on getting the trade deals done; let’s move let’s move we want a good deal but let’s move,\\'” she said, adding that her good relationship with Trump is a boon to the state. “I mean, he will take my calls.”\\ncongress\\n                    By BURGESS EVERETTErnst partly attributed Trump’s sagging popularity in the state to his trade war. While she\\'s confident the president will carry Iowa again, she warned it\\'s going to be a lot harder if Trump doesn\\'t strike trade deals to break the impasse with China.J.B. Poersch, president of the Democratic Senate Majority PAC, said the rising trade deficit could also drag down Ernst. The United States had a record trade deficit with China in 2018. Those numbers improved slightly in January, with China agreeing to increase its purchase of soybeans as part of trade negotiations.“The budget debts, the trade deficit — they’re all remarkably high and have worsened in a Republican administration clearly at a time when Republicans were running everything,” Poersch said. “That’s what she considered her key strategic issue.”Ernst’s race in a battleground state comes at a time when her party badly needs her.Republicans have struggled to recruit female candidates and appeal to female voters. The problem came to a head during the confirmation hearing of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, when a group of white Republican men on the Senate Judiciary Committee grilled Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault when they were in high school. He denied the allegation.\"It\\'s pretty obvious on some of the biggest fights that we had people who look like me and not enough people look like her,” Cornyn, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said.Fellow Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley said Ernst is \"solving our problems by being a good Republican senator and encouraging other women to run as a role model.”Ernst emphasized in 2014 that she wasn’t “running on my gender.” But she did manage to become the first woman elected to federal office from Iowa. Since then, Iowa has elected its first female state House Speaker, Linda Upmeyer, and first female governor, Kim Reynolds.“I think it really undercuts Democratic rhetoric that somehow there is a war on women,” said Jeff Kaufmann, chairman of the Iowa Republican Party. \"If there is a war here in this state, we have women as our generals.”Ernst got more personal about her own experience with sexual assault — amid a public divorce.“It’s been very hard, I would say, sharing my own story,” she said. “It was important for me to acknowledge and hopefully be able to inspire other men and women because it’s not just women, there are men that are going through this as well.”Ernst said her party can attract more suburban female voters by paying attention to issues that affect them, like the cost of pharmaceuticals.Upmeyer, Iowa’s first female House speaker, credits Ernst with being a role model for other female politicians in Iowa.“Whether it’s a violence, or a divorce, or even the struggle of climbing the ladder and having the opportunity be a U.S. senator,\" she said, women \"can relate to that.\" Missing out on the latest scoops?

Though O’Rourke announced his candidacy earlier this month — climbing on to tables and café countertops in cramped venues as he sprinted across eight states — his appearance in El Paso was orchestrated to introduce O’Rourke to the Democratic electorate from a more presidential perch.Speaking against the backdrop of an archway blocks from the U.S.-Mexico border, O’Rourke denounced a political system in which “unrestrained money and influence has warped the priorities of this country” and “corrupted our democracy.”“For too long in this country, the powerful have maintained their privilege at the expense of the powerless,” O’Rourke said. “They have used fear and division in the same way that our current president uses fear and division, based on the differences between us of race, of ethnicity, of geography or religion to keep us apart, to make us angry, to make us afraid of ourselves and of one another.”As the crowd chanted “Beto, Beto!” and waved black-and-white signs reading “Viva Beto” and “Beto for President,” O’Rourke said, “This is a campaign for America.”The rally filled an intersection and part of a block of a historic thoroughfare in El Paso’s downtown. Police officers unofficially estimated the crowd at about 1,000 to 2,000 people, while O’Rourke’s campaign put the number at more than 6,000.\\n                            Beto and Amy O’Rourke pose for photos with supporters in El Paso on Saturday. | Tamir Kalifa for POLITICOO’Rourke’s campaign, citing police in Houston, said some 10,500 people were on hand for his rally at Texas Southern University, where O’Rourke echoed many of the morning’s themes. Standing in front of a large American flag, he vowed to run a campaign to “bring people together” regardless of political affiliation.In El Paso, while O’Rourke rarely mentioned President Donald Trump by name, he repeatedly invoked the policies and rhetoric of the Republican president, especially on immigration. Standing just blocks from the U.S.-Mexico border — where scores of asylum-seekers were being held under an overpass — O’Rourke pointed to “those who are just three or four blocks from here, detained under the international bridge that connects us with Mexico behind chain-link fence and barbed wire. … They are our fellow human beings.”He called for an end to “these love affairs with dictators and strong men all around the world” and urged the United States to refocus its foreign policy to “reprioritize this hemisphere — those countries and people who are literally connected to us by land.”“We can try to solve the problems of Central America here at our front door, at the Texas-Mexico border,” O’Rourke said. “Or we can invest in the opportunities to help the people of Central America where they are at home.”\\n2020 elections\\n                    By MAGGIE SEVERNS and JAMES ARKINThe border — and the charged subject of immigration — has provided O’Rourke his clearest opening to confront Trump. The former Texas congressman hails from the heavily Democratic border city that shares a culture — and skyline — with Juárez, Mexico.Before announcing his presidential campaign, O’Rourke drew thousands of supporters to a February protest rally countering Trump’s visit to the city and the president\\'s call for funding for a border wall. And O’Rourke has gone further than many of his Democratic competitors on the issue, saying he would remove existing border barriers along the Rio Grande in El Paso.But in a sweeping address on Saturday, O’Rourke also called for expanding health care access, paying teachers more, strengthening labor unions, addressing climate change, banning workplace discrimination and enacting paid family leave. He called for decriminalizing marijuana and expunging the records of those arrested for possessing the drug. He called for expanding services for veterans and ending the country’s involvement in foreign wars.“Whatever our differences — where you live, who you love, to whom you pray, for whom you voted in the last election, let those differences not define us or divide us at this moment,” O’Rourke said. “Let’s agree going forward, before we are anything else, we are Americans first.”\\n                            O\\'Rourke speaks at Texas Southern University in Houston on Saturday. | Tamir Kalifa for POLITICOO’Rourke held his Texas debut one day before the end of the first fundraising quarter of the year, marrying his homecoming rally to a furious online organizing effort. The campaign coordinated more than 1,000 viewing parties throughout the United States, while warning supporters that despite the staggering $6.1 million O’Rourke raised in the first 24 hours of his campaign — surpassing every other candidate and his advisers’ expectations — he was still running from behind.“Beto is playing catch up to other candidates with more campaign funds,” the campaign emailed supporters on Friday. “Some of our opponents started with millions of dollars from past campaigns. Plus Beto has had a lot less time to fundraise since we launched so recently. Still, we\\'ll be compared to other candidates for president in these reports.”O’Rourke is beginning his campaign far behind former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Sanders (I-Vt.) in early polls and is running about even with Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Warren (D-Mass.), according to Morning Consult.\\nCulture Club \\n                    By VIRGINIA HEFFERNANBut unconstrained by public office or any other job, O’Rourke is campaigning at a frenetic pace. After his Texas rallies, he plans to speak at the progressive We the People summit in Washington on Monday and at the Rev. Al Sharpton’s National Action Network conference the next day in New York. He will then return to Iowa for nearly two dozen events over four days in the first-in-the-nation caucus state.In El Paso — and in Houston and Austin — O’Rourke sought to reinvigorate Texas Democrats he first captivated in his closer-than-expected loss to Sen. Ted Cruz in Texas’ Senate race last year. O’Rourke is widely popular among Democrats in Texas but he has acknowledged he will have to compete hard in the state in 2020. The Democratic primary includes another Texan, Julián Castro, and Harris, among other contenders, has been seeking to make inroads in the Super Tuesday state.O’Rourke has put El Paso, a West Texas city of about 680,000 people, at the center of his presidential campaign, routinely lacing his remarks with references to his experiences in the border city.Speaking Saturday a short walk from his home, O’Rourke found an audience who could finish his line when he said, as he has many times: “We are safe not despite the fact that we are a city of immigrants and asylum-seekers. We are safe because we are a city of immigrants and asylum-seekers.”He added, “We have learned not to fear our differences, but to respect and embrace them.”Missing out on the latest scoops?

I was embarrassed. I was shocked. I was confused.”From that encounter to his ongoing apology tour for the way he handled sexual harassment allegations against Justice Clarence Thomas to an awkward float about a possible running mate to mounting questions about his son’s business dealings in Ukraine, Biden has been reminded in short order of the lingering questions he’ll need to address. Namely, whether there is a place for a 76-year-old white male career politician in a historic diverse field of candidates, and whether his long career in public service has left him with a record that is out of sync with a party that’s rapidly moving leftward.

Andrew Cuomo. “Primaries are tough, and Joe Biden, when you’re this old and running for president, you have a pretty long record for people to go through.” Biden spokesman Bill Russo indicated that Friday’s allegation was a surprise.“Neither then, nor in the years since, did he or the staff with him at the time have an inkling that Ms. Flores had been at any time uncomfortable,” Russo said in a written statement, “nor do they recall what she describes.”A picture from the event also shows Biden also burying his nose in the hair of actress and activist Eva Longoria. Katz, a former staffer in the U.S. Senate — where Biden had served for 36 years before becoming President Barack Obama’s vice president in 2009 — said it was easy to believe Flores’ accusation.“The thing that’s so challenging for team Biden is that everything that Lucy Flores said seems very, very true,” Katz said. “There’s literally highlight reels of Biden, whether it’s with world leaders or granddaughters of incoming members of Congress, doing things that seem a little off — on camera.”Cristobal Alex, a Biden adviser referenced anonymously in Flores’ account, said in a statement that he felt “sucker-punched and surprised” when he read the essay. He contended that Flores misrepresented a private conversation with him and that her recollection of the event did not match his.\\n2020 elections\\n                    By KATIE GALIOTOStill, the rise of the #MeToo movement and a trove of videos and photos have placed Biden under fresh scrutiny. While Biden’s Democratic critics make sure to add that there’s no comparing him to President Donald Trump — who has been accused by multiple women of sexual harassment and once said in a hot-mic moment that he could grab and kiss women because “when you’re a star, they let you do it” — they also concede the focus on Biden’s overly familiar style will make it more difficult to draw a sharp contrast with Trump.Yet that isn’t all Biden is contending with. Three days before Flores went public, Biden was busy expressing regret for his treatment of another woman of color involving a different sexual harassment issue: The 1991 Senate Judiciary Committee hearings he chaired in 1991, in which Anita Hill accused Thomas of improper behavior.“She paid a terrible price. She was abused through the hearing,” Biden said of Hill during the Biden Courage Awards ceremony in New York. “To this day, I regret I couldn’t get her the kind of hearing she deserved.”The attempts to tackle the Hill issue have failed to put the issue behind him — despite what amount to public apologies, Biden continues to draw criticism for not taking responsibility for his handling of the hearings and not apologizing directly to Hill.Democratic pollster Joel Benenson, who was the chief strategist for Obama’s and Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaigns, noted that “the public is going to be the ultimate arbiter of whether the regret and whether what he says on this issue is sufficient.”Sandwiched between those two flaps was a third concerning 2018 Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, who appeared on two television shows to shoot down rumors she would join Biden’s ticket as a running mate before he clinched the nomination.The trial balloon, which appeared to come from Biden’s inner circle, didn’t have the intended effect. Far from generating excitement about the prospect of introducing an element of youth and diversity to his prospective bid, the float smacked of desperation.A Biden spokesman denied that there were “discussions on a precooked ticket,” calling them ”false, plain and simple.”Benenson sounded surprised by the rumors that Biden advisers wanted to pick Abrams as a running mate before he even announced.\\n2020 elections\\n                    By CARLA MARINUCCI“Voters ultimately do not like gimmicks. They also, I believe, don’t like the presumption of announcing your vice presidential choice before you’re the nominee,” Benenson said. “Iowa and New Hampshire are retail politics on steroids. And for you to suggest that you are looking past them and deciding who your vice president should be? I think it plays wrong.”Republicans were gleeful at the prospect of Biden either making the move or being so flat-footed that he didn’t suppress the rumors fast enough because it made him look weak.“This is consultant malpractice,” said Florida GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz, a top Trump defender and surrogate. “Either they actually considered this as a trial balloon and didn’t realize how bad it made Biden look or they didn’t get in front of it to shoot it down because they wanted it to be true. ... We hope he gets in the race and we hope he’s the Democrats’ nominee.”Republicans and Democrats alike are laying the groundwork to face Biden by examining the business deals of his son, Hunter Biden, when Joe Biden was vice president. It’s an issue of such grave concern to Biden, who lost his other son, Beau Biden, to cancer, that he has told close associates it’s a major factor in his decision of whether to run.To start off the week, the conservative website One America News Network featured a report Monday about Hunter Biden’s ties to a Ukrainian oligarch and a natural gas company in 2014, an arrangement that was also criticized a year later in a New York Times editorial.As with the allegations lodged by Flores against Joe Biden, the former vice president must not only determine how to respond but also how to answer critics who will say his son\\'s business interests would make it harder for him as a nominee to contrast his record with Trump on the question of ties to Russia. Trump’s defenders, who have blamed Ukrainian intelligence for some of the Trump-Russia stories, say they look forward to making Democrats pay for it if and when Biden enters the race.“I’m pretty confident Joe Biden will be called out by his presidential primary competitors for his son getting rich off a corrupt Ukrainian oligarch’s gas company,” said Michael Caputo, a former Trump campaign consultant and top Trump defender.He pointed to a connection with Trump’s former campaign manager that should make Democrats uneasy.“Wait till they find out Hunter Biden’s oligarch is from the same political party Paul Manafort consulted in Ukraine,” he said. “Old ‘Lunch Bucket Joe’ would be smart to not even get in the race.”Alex Thompson contributed to this report.Missing out on the latest scoops?

Apart from the accusation that he murdered a teenage ISIS fighter under his care, military prosecutors contend that he held his re-enlistment ceremony with the detainee’s corpse. Gallagher is also accused of shooting two civilians in Iraq and firing inadvertently into crowds.He was arrested in September while receiving treatment as a wounded warrior at Camp Pendleton in California and has since been held at San Diego’s Naval Consolidated Brig Miramar. Rep. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.) previewed the president’s intervention in Gallagher’s case on Friday, tweeting that he had spoken with Trump about the matter by phone and thanked him for “deciding to move Chief Ghallager [sic] to less restrictive confinement” while he awaits trial.“Eddie Gallagher is a two-time recipient of the Bronze Star, and served our nation on eight tours of duty under conditions most of us could not fathom,” Norman wrote online. “As I\\'ve said from the start, I believe Chief Gallagher will soon have a fair and impartial trial.

Trump tagged \"Fox & Friends\" in his tweet. “I have to say, I have to thank you and Brian and Steve and particularly Congressman Ralph Norman and especially President Trump for exercising commonsense and human decency in allowing my brother to be relieved from a prison of convicted sex offenders so that he can actually meet with his lawyers, see his family, see sunlight and be treated like a human being ahead of his trial so that he can properly prepare to defend himself,” Sean Gallagher told Fox News host Pete Hegseth.“At this point, we\\'re pretty confident the White House is going to today make something happen,” he added.Missing out on the latest scoops?

Funds for these subsidies would be obtained from tariffs and sales of public lands.”Despite the American System’s uneven pattern of adoption, Clay, in a speech in Cincinnati in 1830, subsequently declared:“That system has had a wonderful success. It has more than realized all the hopes of its founders. It has completely falsified all the predictions of its opponents. It has increased the wealth, and power, and population of the nation. It has diminished the price of articles of consumption and has placed them within the reach of a far greater number of our people than could have found means to command them if they had been manufactured abroad instead of at home.”“Are we doomed to behold our industry languish and decay yet more and more?” Clay asked his fellow House members as the vote neared. “But there is a remedy, and that remedy consists in modifying our foreign policy and in adopting a genuine ‘American System.’ We must naturalize the arts in our country, and we must naturalize them by the only means which the wisdom of nations has yet discovered to be effectual: by adequate protection against the otherwise overwhelming influence of foreigners.”The Tariff of 1824 was the first one in which the sectional interests of the North and the South came into direct conflict. Southern cotton growers, having found a ready market in Britain and other European countries, feared retaliation. Northern manufacturers and Western farmers produced largely for the domestic market and were more immune from tariff actions against the United States than Southern growers.In the wake of Clay’s appeal, the House narrowly approved the tariff bill, with the support of Northwest and Middle Atlantic legislators and against strong Southern opposition. The bill also narrowly carried in the Senate. President John Quincy Adams signed the legislation in May 1824.Democratic President Andrew Jackson, Adams’ successor in office, opposed Clay’s expansive approach to public policy. He vetoed a bill to authorize federal funding to build a road from Lexington to the Ohio River. He argued that since the road was to be entirely in Kentucky, it did not qualify as interstate commerce as required by the Constitution’s Commerce Clause.SOURCE: WWW.SENATE.GOVMissing out on the latest scoops?

The federal power utility determined its Paradise Unit 3 facility in Kentucky, along with the Bull Run power plant in Tennessee, was too expensive to keep running. “He’s got a keen understanding of the legislative and regulatory process, and increasingly the energy business is intertwined with government policy,” a federal government official who knows Joe Craft said. “He knows a lot of people. A lot of people respect him and he’s a prominent figure, so I imagine he can pick up the phone and call anybody.” Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politicsBy signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

The couple gave $2 million to Trump\\'s political efforts through campaign donations and a share of his inauguration, according to OpenSecrets.org and Federal Election Commission filings.“He’s been a longtime supporter of Republican candidates and causes,” Rep. Andy Barr (R-Ky.), to whom Joe Craft has donated, told POLITICO. “I think Joe is pretty well-known by Cabinet members, by the president, by the vice president.”Craft\\'s company also weighed in to nix potential nominee David Hill from joining the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, in part because Hill criticized the administration\\'s intent to bail out economically distressed coal and nuclear power plants. Those bailout plans have run aground due to legal concerns. FERC is now considering whether certain facilities going offline would present a problem for maintaining a steady, secure supply of electricity, as proponents of incentives for cash-strapped generators have claimed. Craft would stand to benefit from such interventions.Craft has also had sway at the EPA, which has been at the center of efforts to lessen the regulatory burden on coal. Craft regularly communicated with former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, with whom he bonded over their Kentucky roots and Oklahoma careers: Pruitt lived in Tulsa when he was the state’s attorney general. The New York Times reported last June that Pruitt secured prime tickets for a college basketball game at the University of Kentucky, where Craft is a major fan and booster. (The team’s practice facility bears his name.)“He has his own transportation so he can drop in on a UK ballgame and then fly into Washington to meet with the Trump administration for breakfast the next morning,” said Dave Adkisson, president of the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce, who visited the Crafts with the chamber’s board of directors in Canada last October.\\nCongress\\n                    By LAUREN GARDNERJoe Craft’s allies describe him and his wife as humble, genuine people dedicated to philanthropic causes. They say Joe Craft cares deeply about his eastern Kentucky home region and his adopted Tulsa community.Barr said Craft’s story “is the American dream.” Coming from humble beginnings in eastern Kentucky’s coal-heavy Perry County, he went to University of Kentucky, then its law school, before heading into the business on which his community was built — coal. He learned the business “from the bottom up” to create “one of the most extraordinary energy companies, I would say not just in the United States, but the world,” Barr said.Craft amassed a fortune along the way and pumped some of it into educational and other endeavors in Kentucky and Oklahoma. He donated $7.7 million to various universities and causes through his charity, the Joseph W. Craft III Foundation, according to 990 filings from 2014 through 2016. One of Craft’s proudest achievements was funding the Craft Academy, a specialized STEM high school in eastern Kentucky, Adkisson said. “He is somewhat reserved, certainly unassuming. He’s not the first person in a meeting to speak up, but when he does, it’s substance. He’s very generous, he’s quietly very generous,” Adkisson said, noting Craft once on the spot pledged to match donations for a Chamber program to send principals of eastern Kentucky businesses to an executive leadership conference — a roughly $100,000 commitment.Craft’s political giving has been less quiet and just as generous. He donated nearly $8.8 million to federal candidates through 2017, more than $8.5 million of which went to Republicans, according to OpenSecrets.org. Federal Election Commission filings showed he gave more than $350,000, all to Republicans, last campaign cycle.\\nForeign Policy\\n                    By KATIE GALIOTOIn 2012, the couple co-hosted an Indiana fundraiser for Romney, according to an invitation that lists other attendees as then-Rep. Mike Pence and ‘80s acting stars Bo Derek and Ricky Schroder. The barbecue took place at the Indiana home of businessman Steve Chancellor, a coal executive and big game trophy hunter. Chancellor now sits on Trump’s wildlife conservation council and lobbied Pruitt to soften pollution rules.Joe Craft has already benefited from a number of Trump administration policies long sought by Republicans and the coal industry. Chiefly, it nixed the Obama administration’s carbon dioxide regulations for power plants, opting for a scaled-back version instead, and announced plans to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.Alliance has fared well given the headwinds facing the coal industry, said Joe Aldina, a coal analyst at S&P Global Platts Analytics. Alliance has weathered slumps in the coal market better than its competitors. When others made risky acquisitions, Craft stayed pat; when they filed for bankruptcy, he stayed afloat.“Alliance is a big success story in the coal markets; he’s got a ton of money, he’s politically connected and all that. It’s hard to infer what his political influence might be,” said Aldina, who said he didn’t have any particular insight in the Trump administration’s inner sanctum. “I think Alliance is a well-run company overall, which has made Joe Craft a lot of money and given him some influence.”Alexander Panetta contributed to this report.Missing out on the latest scoops?

The flurry of attention over a potential presidential bid shows how she’s catapulted in the past year from a little-known Democrat locked in a competitive primary for governor to star status in national Democratic politics.The race for 2020 starts now.

She’s attended dozens of events across the country, according to descriptions of her itinerary from sources close to Abrams and others who’ve spoken with her. She also drew high marks for her performance delivering Democrats’ response to President Donald Trump’s State of the Union speech in February.All the while, Abrams, who maintains a spreadsheet of her life ambitions, has stoked the buzz surrounding her next move by taking meetings with national figures from Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer to former Vice President Joe Biden. Abrams is well aware of the intrigue and knows that even amid the early jostling among Democratic presidential candidates, there is a spotlight on her. She is taking advantage of the interest to expand her network and make new connections that will help her regardless of her next steps, according to allies and advisers. Abrams has discussed her options with some top Democratic contributors.“I’m trying to encourage her to run for the Senate, and I’m hoping she will,” said Elizabeth Bagley, a major Democratic donor and former ambassador to Portugal who spoke recently to Abrams. “She’s amazing. So bright, very personable, very strategic.”Abrams started to assemble a national network ahead of her run for governor through the New Georgia Project, a nonprofit she formed that’s focused on voter registration and engagement. She courted donors, including George Soros, who aided her campaign for governor.\\nelections\\n                    By ALEX ISENSTADTSince her loss, Abrams has spoken at events ranging from a Lesbians Who Tech conference in San Francisco to the Bloomberg Equality Summit in New York and an upcoming sit-down with Valerie Jarrett, the former adviser to Barack Obama. She has also done events to boost her profile beyond the political bubble, with stops in places including Oxford, England, and an ideas summit for TV writers in Los Angeles that featured celebrities including John Legend.In December, Abrams was a keynote speaker at a conference hosted by Way to Win, a collective of progressive donors focused on turning Southern states blue that spent $22 million last cycle. Two hundred people attended the event in Manhattan Beach, Calif.“I think that Democrats would be hard-pressed to do better,” said Tory Gavito, co-founder of Way to Win. “Having a leader like her really stands for big ideas across these states, both in the emerging South, and in Southwest states like Arizona, Texas and Georgia.”Throughout her national travels, Abrams has attempted to draw attention to her mission on voting rights and her gubernatorial race. “Wherever she goes, she shares the stories of those who faced these suppressive tactics with new audiences,” said Caitlin Highland, an Abrams spokeswoman. Republicans say Abrams’ national activities could haunt her back home if she runs for Senate. Her out-of-state travel has drawn scrutiny from the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which ran a video series titled “Where in the World is Stacey Abrams?”“As best I can tell she’s waiting on one more position to come open, emperor, and see if that fits her taste,” said Georgia Republican Party Chairman John Watson. “Stacey is on the national circuit. If that’s the game she wants to play, that’s up to her. We\\'re focused on Georgia priorities, Georgia people, getting our grassroots and fundraising up to pace.”Democrats, however, don’t think it will hurt her.\\n2020 Elections \\n                    By KATIE GALIOTO“Stacey is a national figure at this point, I don’t think there\\'s anything to do to change that,” said Jason Carter, Democrats’ 2014 gubernatorial nominee in Georgia. “I don’t think it was a negative when she ran for governor. There’s certainly no downside.” Democrats in Washington want Abrams to run for Senate, viewing her as the best option to put the state in play. She’s met with Schumer several times, most recently last week. But even as she raises her national profile, Abrams has kept a steady presence in Georgia, too.She spoke at an Asian Americans Advancing Justice conference in Atlanta in March and attended an Atlanta Hawks event dedicated to supporting cancer awareness and Historically Black Colleges and Universities in February. She’s done nearly a half-dozen “thank you” events for supporters of her gubernatorial race across the state — the final one is on Sunday. Bianca Keaton, head of the Gwinnett County Democratic Party, hosted an event for Abrams last month in Duluth, Ga., just outside Atlanta. Keaton said Georgia Democrats are split over what they’d like to see Abrams do: Some argue she should run for president, others want her to take on Perdue. Keaton herself is agnostic. “I just want her on my ballot in 2020,” she said.Missing out on the latest scoops?

The House Oversight Committee plans to vote Tuesday on issuing subpoenas to Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross for documents related to Ross\\' decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census. Story Continued BelowChairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) is seeking a memo and note that James Uthmeier, of the Commerce Department\\'s office of general counsel, wrote to Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Gore about the controversial query in fall 2017. Cummings is also seeking testimony from Gore, and wants lawmakers to see \"[a]ll documents and communications from January 20, 2017, through December 12, 2017, within the Department of Justice and with outside entities regarding the request to add a citizenship question to the census, including but not limited to the White House, the Commerce Department, the Republican National Committee, the Trump Campaign, or Members of Congress.\"Cummings on Friday urged Ross to agree by Monday to provide additional documents detailing why he added the citizenship question — the first of its type in 60 years — and complained in a letter that Ross has repeatedly snubbed the committee on document requests related to the matter. Cummings suggested the committee would consider forcing cooperation by subpoena during the committee\\'s Tuesday meeting if the secretary does not agree to the terms of the letter.The Oversight panel is also set to vote on a subpoena for congressional testimony from former White House Personnel Security Director Carl Kline, likely in relation to a committee probe into the controversy surrounding White House adviser Jared Kushner\\'s clearance levels.A federal judge ruled in January against asking about respondents\\' citizenship in the census, arguing doing so could potentially be discriminatory against non-citizens. The question has gone to the Supreme Court, which will hear arguments on the issue early next month.Ross has denied that the question was politically motivated and said he added it at the request of the Justice Department. House Democrats grilled the secretary during a hearing March 14 and strongly doubted Ross acted at the Justice Department\\'s behest based on his past behavior pointing to a politically motivated agenda.A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Cummings\\' letter stated the committee has been repeatedly shortchanged in its requests for documents that could elucidate the secretary\\'s motivations for adding a citizenship question. Several emails provided to the committee were fully or mostly redacted, and the department said it had provided documents that the committee never received, the letter said.Commerce argued the redactions were irrelevant to the committee\\'s probe, but Cummings responded that the department\\'s inconsistencies cast doubt on that claim. He said the committee will review some of the documents to determine if they are irrelevant on Monday.A Commerce Department spokesperson said in a statement that the department \"has cooperated in good faith with the Committee and will look to do so in the future.”“The Department has delivered over 11,000 pages of documents pertaining to the Committee’s request and the Secretary himself voluntarily testified for nearly seven hours on these issues two weeks ago,” the statement said.Ross also snubbed an invitation to testify before the Senate Appropriations Committee this month for a routine probe into the department\\'s finances, garnering indignant reactions from congressional Democrats.“Secretary Ross: You’re not an investment banker anymore,” ranking Democrat Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) said in a statement.Kyle Cheney contributed to this reportMissing out on the latest scoops?

Trump decried the increases as impediments to growth as he pushed for at least 4 percent economic growth. The conflict led to whispers of the ouster of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell.The Federal Reserve recently has lowered its forecast for growth in 2019 to 2.1 percent, citing trade tensions and slowing global growth, and this week revised down growth in the fourth quarter of last year. It announced last week it would most likely not increase interest rates this year.

Instead, he made me feel uneasy, gross, and confused.” Lucy Flores (left), the former Democratic nominee for Nevada lieutenant governor, wrote. | Ethan Miller/Getty Images\\n2020 elections\\n                    By KATIE GALIOTO03/29/2019 06:04 PM EDTLucy Flores, the former Democratic nominee for Nevada lieutenant governor, on Friday accused former Vice President Joe Biden of what she described as an inappropriate encounter when he campaigned for her in 2014. Writing in “The Cut,” Flores said she was standing at the side of the stage at a campaign rally when she felt Biden approach her from behind and lean in to smell her hair.Story Continued Below “He proceeded to plant a big slow kiss on the back of my head,” Flores wrote. “My brain couldn’t process what was happening. I was embarrassed. I was shocked. I was confused.” “I couldn’t move and I couldn’t say anything. I wanted nothing more than to get Biden away from me,” she added. “My name was called and I was never happier to get on stage in front of an audience.” It’s unclear what sort of impact the accusation will have on Biden’s decision on whether to join the 2020 presidential field. Biden has long had a reputation for overly familiar physical contact with women — most notably when he massaged the shoulders of new Defense Secretary Ash Carter’s wife in 2015 and during swearing-in ceremonies for senators and their families.

But Biden’s behavior is now getting more attention in the #MeToo era, and Flores’ accusation could further heighten the scrutiny as the former vice president considers a 2020 presidential bid. “Vice President Biden was pleased to support Lucy Flores’s candidacy for lieutenant governor of Nevada in 2014 and to speak on her behalf at a well-attended public event. Neither then, nor in the years since, did he or the staff with him at the time have an inkling that Ms. Flores had been at any time uncomfortable, nor do they recall what she describes,” said Bill Russo, a spokesperson for Biden. “But Vice President Biden believes that Ms. Flores has every right to share her own recollection and reflections, and that it is a change for better in our society that she has the opportunity to do so. He respects Ms. Flores as a strong and independent voice in our politics and wishes her only the best.  Flores, who served as a Nevada assemblywoman from 2010 to 2014, wrote that seeing photos of Biden “getting uncomfortably close with women and young girls” over the course of his vice presidency showed an ignorance of “the power imbalance that exists between Biden and the women he chooses to get cozy with.” “Biden was the second-most powerful man in the country and, arguably, one of the most powerful men in the world,” Flores wrote. “He was there to promote me as the right person for the lieutenant governor job. Instead, he made me feel uneasy, gross, and confused.” For months Biden has been mulling a presidential run, a decision he’s said he’s “very close” to making, possibly as soon as early April. Flores wrote that news of Biden’s potential candidacy “without much talk about his troubling past as it relates to women” spurred her to write about her encounter with the former vice president five years prior. “I’m not suggesting that Biden broke any laws, but the transgressions that society deems minor (or doesn’t even see as transgressions) often feel considerable to the person on the receiving end,” she wrote. “That imbalance of power and attention is the whole point — and the whole problem.”Missing out on the latest scoops?

The providers include an anti-abortion chain of clinics, as well as several states and provider groups that are threatening to drop out of the program if conservative-led changes go into effect in a few weeks.The new rules — designed largely to partially achieve conservatives\\' long-sought goal of cutting off public funding for Planned Parenthood — would block Title X grants from going to groups that make abortion referrals, potentially leaving gaps in care for low-income women. It\\'s already illegal to use federal taxpayer dollars for abortion, with very limited exceptions.Story Continued BelowAccording to a list of grantees posted on HHS\\' website Friday, seven Planned Parenthood affiliates in eight states are still set to receive funding through 2022 beginning on Monday. Oregon and Washington state\\'s health departments will also continue to serve as the sole grantees in those states. Those states and Planned Parenthood are suing to block the new anti-abortion rules due to take effect May 3, and threatening to withdraw unless federal courts step in.Planned Parenthood\\'s $16 million-a-year allotment is a steep drop from the $50 to 60 million the group had been receiving annually. Several of the group\\'s affiliates, including the one in Wisconsin that now serves 87 percent of the state\\'s Title X patients, will not receive grants.Get the latest on the health care fight, every weekday morning — in your inbox.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

The group was turned down in 2018 because it doesn\\'t provide birth control other than natural family planning and abstinence. The organization had previously discussed partnering with other providers that cover contraception in order to qualify for Title X dollars. Obria said Friday that it will oversee seven clinics in four California counties, only three of which are their own affiliates. Its founder confirmed to POLITICO that at least some of the group\\'s partners will offer the contraceptive services required under Title X.An HHS spokesperson said groups like Obria that don\\'t offer birth control \"may participate as part of a project as long as the entire project offers a broad range of family planning services.\"Meanwhile, conservative state governments in Texas and Missouri were rejected for the latest round of grants.Texas lost its Title X funding under the Obama administration after the state pushed Planned Parenthood out of the program and contracted with anti-abortion providers. The state was anticipating winning back the funding from the Trump administration this year.Missouri was also rejected last year. The state currently has one Title X grantee, the Missouri Family Health Council, which said that it’s waiting to see if the courts block the new Trump rules from taking effect before deciding if it will stay in the program.HHS unveiled new, contentious rules for the Title X program in late February. The 2019 grantees applied for funds under the old rules. The program’s grant cycle officially starts on Monday.Major advocacy groups and 22 states and the District of Columbia have filed lawsuits against the new rule in federal courts, arguing they undermine patient care. Grantees are allowed to withdraw from the program, and HHS can move to try and fill their spot, according to HHS.Victoria Colliver contributed to this report.CORRECTION:  An earlier version of this story misstated the status of the Wisconsin Planned Parenthood affiliate\\'s funding.

Barr cited Trump\\'s public statements deferring to him.Story Continued Below“Everyone will soon be able to read it on their own,” Barr stated.Barr emphasized that he would be removing four categories of information from the nearly-400-page report: grand jury information, information related to intelligence sources and methods, information pertinent to ongoing investigations and anything that could harm the \"reputational interests\" of \"peripheral third parties.\" The scale of these redactions may determine how much of a fight Barr is in for with House Democrats, who have demanded the entire report and its underlying evidence.Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politicsBy signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) said an April 2 deadline set by his committee to access the full report \"still stands.\" He said Congress expects to see the report without redactions and to review all of its underlying evidence by that date. In addition, he and other Democrats are asking Barr to join them before a judge to release grand jury information so that Barr doesn\\'t need to redact it. \"There is ample precedent for the Department of Justice sharing all of the information that the Attorney General proposes to redact to the appropriate congressional committees,\" Nadler said. Rep. Doug Collins (R-Ga.), the top Republican on the House Judiciary panel, said Friday in a tweet that Nadler “stands alone in setting arbitrary deadlines for that release and in calling the attorney general to break the law by releasing the report without redactions.”\\nwhite house\\n                    By GABBY ORRThere has been intense pressure on Barr to release the full report that Mueller submitted at the conclusion of his probe into the Trump campaign\\'s links to Russian operatives working to interfere in the 2016 election. According to Barr, the special counsel concluded that Trump’s campaign did not criminally conspire with the Russian government to sway the election. But Mueller did not deliver a final verdict on whether the president obstructed justice.In his letter, Barr bristled at what he described as an inaccurate characterization of the four-page memo he issued last week regarding Mueller\\'s report. Barr said he never intended that memo to be construed as an exhaustive summary of Mueller\\'s findings. Rather, he said, it was a summary of Mueller\\'s \"principal conclusions\" -- the \"bottom line\" of his findings.Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) criticized Barr on Thursday for going beyond Mueller\\'s report and deciding that Trump should be absolved of obstruction of justice even though Mueller found evidence to support both sides of the question. Mueller explicitly opted to \"not exonerate\" Trump, a head-scratching phrase that has led Democrats to demand more details from the report itself.Barr\\'s initial summary of Mueller\\'s conclusions also omitted central swaths of the areas Mueller investigated, including whether he reached counterintelligence findings that might show whether any Americans were compromised by Russians even if they committed no crimes. Barr said the report was nearly 400 pages but that it also included additional appendices and tables.Missing out on the latest scoops?

The court ruled Friday that a judicial panel will not review a complaint by the Americans for Prosperity Foundation. | Marcio Jose Sanchez, File/AP Photo \\nLegal \\n                        The Americans for Prosperity Foundation has been fighting a California requirement to disclose its largest donors.\\n                    By JOSH GERSTEIN03/29/2019 02:34 PM EDTA Koch brothers-aligned group will not get a larger judicial panel to review its complaint that California is infringing the group’s First Amendment rights by demanding a list of large donors.But the Friday ruling from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals came over the protest of five of the court’s judges.Story Continued BelowThe group, the Americans for Prosperity Foundation, is part of a network of groups founded by conservative megadonors Charles and David Koch. It has been fighting the California requirement in the federal courts for years. In 2016, a federal judge in Los Angeles blocked the requirement, saying it put the donors in peril and that California has done a poor job of keeping the information private. However, last September, a three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit reversed that decision, calling it “clearly erroneous.” On Friday, the same appeals court declined to offer an “en banc” — or 11 judge — review of the case, even though five judges joined a spirited dissent warning that the state appears to be running roughshod over the conservative group’s First Amendment rights.In the dissent, Judge Sandra Ikuta wrote that the threat to Americans for Prosperity members’ rights was real and imminent.“People publicly affiliated with the Foundation have often faced harassment, hostility, and violence, as shown by the evidence adduced at trial in this case,” Ikuta wrote. “At a rally in Michigan, several hundred protestors wielding knives and boxcutters surrounded the Foundation’s tent and sawed at the tent ropes until they were severed.”Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politicsBy signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Kamala Harris, a Democrat, was the California attorney general at the time the litigation began. Current Attorney General Xavier Becerra, also a Democrat and a former congressman, is now overseeing the case.Ikuta called the earlier decision from her colleagues “contrary to the reasoning and spirit of decades of Supreme Court jurisprudence.” She emphasized that the two groups that sued over the California donor-filing requirement are organized as charities, not as groups taking part in election-related advocacy. She also said the Supreme Court has approved donor-disclosure requirements in the electoral context, but not for non-profit groups more generally.“The interests served by disclosure outside the electoral context, such as policing types of charitable fraud, pale in comparison to the crucial importance of ensuring our election system is free from corruption or its appearance,” wrote Ikuta, an appointee of President George W. Bush.\\nhealth care\\n                    By ADAM CANCRYN and DAN DIAMONDIkuta’s dissent was joined by both of the court’s Trump appointees, Judges Mark Bennett and Ryan Nelson, as well as Judges Consuelo Callahan and Carlos Bea, who are George W. Bush appointees.The three judges who issued the ruling last year upholding the California requirement defended their decision in a new joint response released Thursday. They noted that the federal government has long had a similar requirement to lodge donor lists privately with the IRS.“Our colleagues sensibly declined to rehear this case en banc,” wrote Judges Raymond Fisher, Richard Paez and Jacqueline Nguyen, calling the burden on the donors “slight” and “modest.” They also noted that the 2nd Circuit reached the same conclusion last year regarding a parallel New York state law. A Michigan-based conservative organization, the Thomas More Legal Center, also brought a parallel lawsuit and could try to take the issue to SCOTUS.Fisher and Paez were appointed by President Bill Clinton. Nguyen is an appointee of President Barack Obama.A Michigan-based conservative organization, the Thomas More Legal Center, also brought a parallel lawsuit and could try to take the issue to SCOTUS.“We’re assessing the order and reviewing options,” AFP Foundation spokesman Dave Abrams said. “We appreciate the dissent’s recognition of why this case is so important. We’re committed to championing First Amendment liberties for all Americans and speaking out against measures that risk chilling diverse public discourse.”“Charities aren’t above the law,” Becerra said in a statement. “In California, the law says they must report their major donor information. The organization known as Americans for Prosperity ought to be treated no better and no worse than anyone else. They don’t get to hide their activities simply because they wish to operate in darkness.

The 2010 health care law required states to expand Medicaid to those earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty line — or about $17,200 for an individual — in order to receive enhanced funding from the federal government. In its approval letter, CMS also inserted language that could protect it from litigation. Legal aid groups in Kentucky, Arkansas and New Hampshire have sued to stop those states’ Medicaid overhauls. CMS wrote that the Utah plan provides coverage beyond what the state had done originally and therefore, it promotes Medicaid’s underlying purpose.“Members of the Adult Expansion Population, absent the demonstration, would be ineligible for any Medicaid benefits, and absent approval of the amendment, would be eligible only for highly limited benefits,” the agency wrote.Utah is still seeking Trump administration approval for two unprecedented ideas that HHS has so far declined to act on — obtaining the enhanced funding even when a state is covering fewer people than Obamacare envisions, and imposing per-person limits on the amount of federal funds the state receives. If these ideas are ultimately approved, it is likely to open the door for other Republican holdout states to adopt the coverage expansion after resisting it for years but will almost certainly trigger additional court battles.Utah for now is relying on existing Medicaid funding to cover individuals up to the federal poverty line. Under the work requirement, which is less stringent than those of other states, Utah will require some Medicaid enrollees to complete the following activities to keep their coverage: register for work through an online system; complete an assessment of employment training needs; apply for a job; and complete online job training.Coverage under the administration waiver is slated to take effect on April 1 and the work requirement will take effect in January. Poor adults earning above the poverty line, who would otherwise be enrolled in Medicaid expansion, will remain eligible to receive generous Obamacare subsidies to purchase private coverage.Missing out on the latest scoops?

Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney has also been eyeing the Commerce job and McMahon’s exit better positions him to replace Ross.A longtime professional wrestling executive and former Republican Senate candidate, McMahon is an original member of Trump’s Cabinet, having been confirmed for the job in February 2017. She’s also one of just five women in the president’s Cabinet.McMahon and her husband Vince built the company that would go on to become World Wrestling Entertainment, a large multinational corporation best known for creating a universe of brand name professional wrestlers who face off in tightly scripted televised events.McMahon, who has known Trump for years, has kept a relatively low profile at SBA. Unlike other Trump administration Cabinet officials, she has not been dogged by scandal. Inside the White House, she’s seen as a loyal foot soldier. She regularly travels around the country to promote the president’s agenda, including recent trips to promote the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade deal.For the PAC job, senior Republicans had been looking for someone with deep connections to the world of GOP donors — a profile fit by McMahon, who raised millions as a two-time Connecticut Senate candidate. McMahon is expected to fill the vacancy created when Tommy Hicks Jr., a businessman and close ally of the Trump family, left the super PAC to become Republican National Committee co-chairman.It’s unclear who will replace McMahon at the SBA. One possible candidate, according to administration officials, is Pradeep Belur, the agency’s chief of staff, who has taken on a broader portfolio in recent months. One administration official said Belur has left the impression among some Trump aides that he’s interested in the job. Trump has often praised McMahon’s business prowess, calling her \"one of the country\\'s top female executives\" when he announced her nomination to lead the Small Business Administration in December 2016.\\nhealth care\\n                    By ADAM CANCRYN and DAN DIAMONDMcMahon stepped down as CEO of WWE in 2009 to run for Senate in Connecticut.

The Virginia and Colorado senators next week will reintroduce their “Medicare X” plan, which would create a new public option for health insurance — an idea that was originally part of Obamacare but was jettisoned for being seen, at the time, as too progressive.Story Continued Below Even as it moves past current law, their measure envisions far less sweeping change than “Medicare for All” proposals backed by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and some of their Senate colleagues running for president.  Kaine, a former vice presidential candidate, and Bennet, who is mulling his own 2020 run, view the plan — one of a handful of center-left proposals being floated — as an alternative option for progressives who want to expand health care availability but don’t want to eliminate private insurance. In an interview, Kaine said many Americans report high levels of satisfaction with the insurance they receive through their employers and that the goal of the Medicare X proposal is to provide another, lower cost option to people through the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services.Get the latest on the health care fight, every weekday morning — in your inbox.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Members of the plan would have access to the Medicare network of doctor in addition to the benefits of other plans under the Affordable Care Act like maternity and newborn care. It would also establish a reinsurance program to reduce premiums. The latest version of the bill also would expand access to tax credits. Obamacare allows for tax credits for people whose income is up to 400 percent of the federal poverty line. The proposal would remove that cap and allow people who make more than the threshold to be eligible for the tax credit — whether they’re on a Medicare X plan or a private insurance plan. The senators envision phasing in the Medicare X plan over several years. By 2021, it would be available in rural areas with scarce options on the exchange and by 2024, it would be available in all areas. By 2025, the plan would expand to the Small Business Health Options Program Exchange. Republicans have seized on the left’s embrace of Medicare for All, which has been endorsed by Sanders and other Senate Democrats running for president like Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Kamala Harris of California and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has dubbed the idea “the Democrats’ Medicare for None” proposal. The Kentucky Republican signaled in an interview with POLITICO that he was more interested attacking Democratic ideas than leading efforts by President Donald Trump to make the GOP the “party of health care.”\\nhealth care\\n                    By ADAM CANCRYN and DAN DIAMOND Republicans have come under fire after the Justice Department’s surprise decision to endorse a federal court’s ruling to eliminate all of Obamacare, and the GOP appears eager to change the subject. “They want to get rid of Obamacare too,” said Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) “Presidential candidates want to eliminate Obamacare, take a wrecking ball to insurance people get from work, which is 160 million people, and go to a government-run program.”  Of course, not all 2020 Democrats are on board with Medicare for All. Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper has voiced concerns about the proposal; he and Bennet saw their state’s voters reject a single-payer ballot measure in 2016. The proposal so far has no Republican co-sponsors and stands little chance of getting through the Republican-controlled Senate. But Bennet and Kaine say they could see the idea catching on.  “The design for Medicare X is that it starts in rural counties many of which are Republican,” Bennet said. “Ten years ago, I might have heard I don’t want that Bolshevik plan in my county. This time I’m hearing from Republicans, thank you for thinking of us first.” Bennet blasted Republicans for lacking a health care plan of their own and urged them to “stop trying to litigate something from 10 years ago.” “It’s irresponsible,” he said. “It’s pathetic.” Kaine noted that Republicans could start feeling the pressure to do something on health care.  “You end up with this contrast that I think will be increasingly unsustainable politically where President Trump and the GOP are focused on taking health insurance away from millions,” he said. \"What we\\'re doing is offering one more option.\"Burgess Everett contributed to this report.Missing out on the latest scoops?

The president\\'s nominees deserve consideration.\\n                    By SEN. MITCH MCCONNELLApril 01, 2019It took six months of partisan delays — and several railroad accidents — before Democrats let the Senate confirm a federal railroad administrator, even though none of them actually voted against the nominee in the end. It’s been 354 days and counting in Senate purgatory for the president’s nominee to head the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Two-hundred eighty-seven days and counting for the under secretary of state for management. Noncontroversial lower court nominees have languished for weeks and weeks — for no discernible reason — before they, too, were confirmed unanimously. These are just a few examples of the historic obstruction Senate Democrats have visited upon President Trump’s nominees for two years and counting.Story Continued BelowSince January 2017, for the first time in memory, a minority has exploited procedure to systematically obstruct a president from staffing up his administration. This new, across-the-board obstruction is unfair to the president and, more importantly, to the American people. Left unchecked, it is guaranteed to create an unsustainable precedent that would see every future presidency of either party obstructed in the same mindless way.The Senate needs to restore normalcy. And this week, we will vote to do just that.Every presidential election since John Adams beat Thomas Jefferson in 1796 has undoubtedly left some senators disappointed. But never before has the unhappy side then built a systematic effort to keep the new president\\'s administration unstaffed.We aren’t talking about limited opposition to a few high-profile nominees or unusual circumstances. It’s mindless, undiscriminating obstruction for the sake of obstruction. Even uncontroversial lower-level nominees whom literally no senators oppose are not spared.Across the first two years of each of the six presidents preceding President Trump, the Senate only had to hold 24 total cloture votes on nominations. That’s the once-rare procedural step that unlocks an up-or-down confirmation vote even though a minority has sought to block it.And in President Trump’s first two years? We had to hold a stunning 128 cloture votes to advance nominations. Our Democratic colleagues made the Senate jump over five times as many hurdles as in the equivalent periods in the Carter, Reagan, Bush, Clinton, Bush and Obama administrations combined.Because of this obstruction, the Senate’s progress in filling important executive branch positions has been insufficient. Crucial jobs are still being held empty out of political spite. More nominees whom I suspect would be confirmed without opposition are still being delayed indefinitely because our colleagues cannot finish grieving their loss in 2016.The all-encompassing, systematic nature of this obstruction is not part of the Senate’s important tradition of minority rights. It is a new departure from that tradition. And this break with tradition is hurting the Senate, hamstringing our duly elected president, and denying citizens the government they elected.Moreover, if we let this partisan paralysis continue, it will define a new norm for the future. It’s hard to imagine any future presidency of either party would be spared.We can’t accept this. We need to stop this bizarre, new practice. We need to rebuild a nominations process that resembles the way things worked for more than two centuries.Fortunately, the recent past provides a path forward.In January 2013, as President Obama began his second term, I and many other Senate Republicans joined with Democrats to enact bipartisan reform of our nominations rules.Republicans certainly weren’t thrilled with the election result. But instead of throwing a systematic tantrum, we acknowledged that the president should be able to build a government at a reasonable pace.\\n\\n                                                Law And Order\\n\\n                                            By Renato Mariotti\\n\\n                                                History Dept.\\n\\n                                            By Frederic J.

It helped us get lower-tier nominees out of Senate purgatory and into their roles without touching the most consequential vacancies.It was a big step toward restoring Senate tradition. Even with a Democratic president, many Republicans still thought it was the right thing to do. The resolution got 78 votes.These modest changes helped. But they only applied for the Congress in which they were enacted. And the need is much more urgent today.That’s why, this week, the Senate will vote on a proposal to recreate similar, modest steps and make them permanent going forward.Our proposal would only reduce the time a minority can keep delaying lower-tier nominations after a majority has invoked cloture. This would keep the Senate floor moving, saving time that is currently tied up in inoffensive nominations that senators don’t even really debate. And, at last, it would let President Trump fill important vacancies at a more reasonable pace.Democrats overwhelmingly supported changes like these in 2013 when they helped President Obama. And privately, many of our Democratic colleagues tell us they’d be happy to support this new proposal, too — as long as we postpone its effective date until January 2021, when they hope there will be a Democrat occupying the White House.Give me a break. A rules change is either a good idea or it isn’t. The answer cannot depend on whether you like the current occupant of the White House. Simple fairness dictates that there cannot be protections in place for Democratic administrations past and future that magically skip over Republican presidents. And this is especially true under the current extraordinary circumstances Senate Democrats have created.The status quo is unfair, unhealthy, and unsustainable. This president and all future presidents deserve a more functional process for building their administrations.Later this week, every senator will have the chance to vote for these common-sense changes. I sincerely hope that, as in 2013, the Senate can make these reforms through bipartisan regular order. Because the current situation cannot stand — and it won’t.Law And Order\\n\\n                        By Nelson W.

Bush and First Lady Barbara Bush wave to supporters on October 12, 1992, at a campaign rally in Springfield, Pennsylvania. | LUKE FRAZZA/AFP/Getty Images\\nHistory Dept.\\n                        In 1989, Barbara Bush was diagnosed with Graves\\' disease. Then, two years later, George H.W. Bush came down with it—just in time for his re-election campaign.\\n                    By SUSAN PAGEApril 01, 2019Susan Page is Washington bureau chief for USA Today and the author of The Matriarch: Barbara Bush and the Making of an American Dynasty, from which this is excerpted.Soon after her husband was sworn in as president of the United States in 1989, Barbara Bush began losing weight, 18 pounds in all, sudden progress after a lifelong struggle. “I convinced myself it was because I was eating smaller portions and working so hard,” she said in her 1994 memoir. But she also was having trouble with her eyes. They were inflamed and bulging, and sometimes she was seeing double. Aboard Air Force One in February 1989, heading back to Washington after a trip to China, she sat down beside White House physician Lawrence Mohr and described her symptoms. Mohr immediately suspected Graves’ disease, just from examining her eyes. For reasons unknown, her thyroid glands were producing too much of the hormone that regulates the body’s metabolism. (Barbara Bush joked that the sobriquet “doesn’t mean you’ll go to the grave; it’s named for the doctor who diagnosed the ailment.” That would be Robert J. Graves, a 19th-century British physician.) The next day, at the White House, Mohr drew a sample of her blood to test. He consulted with specialists at Walter Reed Medical Center and the Mayo Clinic. Story Continued BelowWhen the doctors told Bush their diagnosis, she was matter-of-fact. “It was like, ‘What do we have to do?’” Mohr told me. That question turned out to be hard to answer. A long process of trial and error, using drugs and then radiation, never eliminated entirely the bothersome symptoms. They would persist for decades. Barbara downplayed her symptoms, but when her husband also contracted the disease—an improbable development, given that the disease is not contagious—many people close to the Bushes wondered if the disease wasn’t having a larger effect than the couple was letting on. In interviews, they suggested that the disease could have made Bush too exhausted to put up a strong fight against his younger upstart rival in the 1992 election, Bill Clinton.Did a medical mystery change history? And, in the process, launch a new American political dynasty, the Clintons, that would define the Democratic Party for a quarter century in the way the Bush family defined the Republicans? In public, Bush dismissed the notion that anything was seriously amiss. “She’s just fine; piece of cake; never broke her stride,” her press secretary, Anna Perez, breezily assured reporters after a treatment at Walter Reed that involved drinking a radioactive substance. In her memoirs, Bush expressed more concern about her dog’s medical plight than her own. Her beloved Millie had developed a different autoimmune disorder, lupus. The first lady “wasn’t feeling great,” Mohr recalled years later, in an interview at his home in Charleston, South Carolina, where he was teaching at the Medical University of South Carolina. “Her eyes were clearly bothering her. She had lost weight. She was feeling fatigued.” More than a year after the diagnosis, in the summer of 1990, her eyes were still swollen and teary, and she was often seeing double. She was trying to wean herself off prednisone, a painful process. The steroid she had taken weakened muscles in her right hip, forcing her to take physical therapy to strengthen them. “I confess, I was in a lot of pain,” she said. Then George H.W. Bush was diagnosed with Graves’ disease, too. In May 1991, the president was jogging at Camp David, in Maryland’s Catoctin Mountains, when he found himself panting and unable to finish. The medical staff on duty gave him an EKG. His heartbeat was irregular, in fibrillation. Barbara had been swimming in the pool at the presidential retreat. She was hurriedly summoned and they boarded the Marine One helicopter for a short flight to the Bethesda Naval Hospital in Maryland. “As I sat there, the most dreadful thoughts ran through my mind: Dear God, this wonderful man must not die,” Barbara Bush recalled. He would stay overnight in a hospital suite as doctors worked to restore his heartbeat to its usual rhythm. He began to do some paperwork. “A little later, as he worked away, I thought: Don’t you dare die. I’ll never forgive you.” Bush was treated with medication, and the doctors made plans to shock his heart back into rhythm the next morning if the drugs didn’t work. That would require putting him under general anesthesia and invoking the 25th Amendment, temporarily shifting the powers of the presidency to Vice President Dan Quayle. Aides debated whether to announce that in advance; after conferring with Bush they did. (The procedure turned out not to be necessary. By morning, his heart was beating steadily again.) The underlying problem was diagnosed as Graves’ disease, the same disorder his wife had, although it affected them in different ways—his heart, her eyes. Like her, his treatment included drinking radioactive iodine. Doctors began drawing blood every day as they tried to carefully moderate his hormone levels. Too little would leave him lethargic; too much risked tripping his heart into fibrillation. The oddity of both Barbara and George Bush being diagnosed with the same noncontagious disease while at the White House posed a medical mystery that was never authoritatively settled. The fact that both were under stress, perhaps coupled with a genetic predisposition for the disease, was the least conspiratorial medical explanation. Their son Marvin’s diagnosis in 1985 of ulcerative colitis was another indication of a possible genetic predisposition for autoimmune disorders in the family. Still, some wondered if there had been an environmental trigger at the White House or in the vice president’s residence, where they had lived for eight years. Or perhaps some aftereffect, innocent or nefarious, from their time in Beijing, where Bush served as the top U.S. diplomat for more than a year. Barbara Bush told me there were “all sorts of rumors about the Russians looking down on us.” The Soviet Embassy was less than a mile from the vice president’s residence, and built on higher ground. Had the Soviets been up to no good? The water and air in the White House already were managed in ways to guard against contamination. The vice president’s residence, though, built in 1893 for the superintendent of the U.S. Naval Observatory, was aging. Second lady Marilyn Quayle was concerned that the Bushes’ ailments might signal some problem there. The water, the plumbing, the paint were tested; nothing notable was found. But there was never a full-fledged investigation into what might have contributed to both Bushes developing the same autoimmune disorder, and within 15 months of each other, not to mention Millie’s ailment. Barbara Bush told me she was inclined to see it as just one of those weird coincidences in life. At the time, she reported that George W. Bush jokingly had called to say she “could end all the talk if his dad and I would just stop drinking out of Millie’s bowl.” There was an unspoken reason some advisers weren’t interested in unleashing an aggressive inquiry: They saw nothing to gain in focusing too much attention on Bush’s diagnosis and in the process fanning concern about his stamina for a second term. Despite his record-breaking approval ratings after the first Gulf War, he ended up facing a difficult reelection campaign. Conservative commentator Pat Buchanan mounted a damaging challenge from the right in the GOP primaries, and a half-dozen Democratic senators and governors vied to take him on in November.“They didn’t want people to think that they were going to elect a damaged president,” John Sununu, then the White House chief of staff, later told me. White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said: “The campaign people were in mortal fear.” In private, Fitzwater and some others close to Bush believed the disease was having a serious impact on the president and on his campaign, though the White House never publicly acknowledged that to voters at the time. “If they hadn’t had Graves’ disease, he would have been reelected, I think,” Fred Malek, his campaign chairman, told me. “Nobody at that point recognized the depths of what that caused.” He said the president “had the energy to get up in the morning and handle his in-box, but he didn’t have the mental energy to initiate, to cause change.” He found it difficult to respond aggressively to the country’s economic challenges and to the political challenges presented by Clinton, whose campaign was emphasizing his youth, vigor and empathy. Bush realized something was wrong. He told Colin Powell, then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, that the medicine he was taking caused “a slowing down of the mental processes” for a time. During the campaign, “I saw a passive, sometimes detached George Bush,” Powell said, not the vigorous leader he had been before. \\n                            Click to buy The Matriarch: Barbara Bush and the Making of an American Dynasty by Susan Page.Fitzwater, who was constantly by Bush’s side, said incidents of fibrillation continued, sometimes leaving the president pale and tired. “He was sick,” Fitzwater said. “He was a different person.”The Clinton camp had a tactical edge and an energy that the Bush team did not. There would be little suspense on Election Night. In the three-way race, Clinton won with 43 percent of the popular vote, carrying 32 states and the District of Columbia. Bush received just 37 percent of the vote, carrying 18 states. And H. Ross Perot received 19 percent of the vote, the largest share of the popular vote for an independent candidate since Teddy Roosevelt ran as a Progressive in 1912. “We all gathered in Dad and Mom’s suite to watch the returns,” daughter Doro Bush Koch would recall. “We were in the living room, and Mom was in the bedroom reading a romance novel. Things were not looking good at all, casting a pall over the room. Periodically, however, Mom would walk in the room and say, ‘What’s it like to drive a car?’ And then walk back out. A few minutes later, she came in and asked, ‘How do you buy an airplane ticket?’” Like it or not, they were about to find out. Evicted from the White House, they were heading back home to Houston.Excerpted from THE MATRIARCH: Barbara Bush and the Making of an American Dynasty by Susan Page. Copyright © 2019.

CUNNINGHAMApril 01, 2019Nelson W. Cunningham has served as a federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York under Rudolph Giuliani, general counsel of the Senate Judiciary Committee under then-chair Joseph R. Biden, and general counsel of the White House Office of Administration under Bill Clinton.Attorney General William Barr is right: For public release of the Mueller report, he has no choice but to redact classified information, and also grand jury information pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e). It’s not optional — it’s the law, designed to protect both the secrecy of grand jury proceedings and our nation’s security.But those of us who have pored over Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s earlier court filings know that redacted documents are not just hard to read, they are almost impossible to understand or to comprehend. In other words, they will absolutely not satisfy the public cry for information. Story Continued BelowClearly, neither the Congress nor the public will be satisfied with a redacted report — which is why the House Judiciary Committee is threatening to fire up the subpoena cannon now that it’s clear Barr won’t meet chairman Jarrold Nadler’s April 2 deadline.Congressional Democrats are right to demand the full report – but they are wrong to ask the attorney general to violate the law. Instead, they should learn from the lessons of Watergate and the example of Special Prosecutor Leon Jaworski and House Judiciary Chair Peter Rodino. They should demand the full report but only for their own use. They should use it as a road map for their own investigation. And they should not wait.In 1974, Jaworski completed his work and produced a report backed by evidence collected by the grand jury. The House Judiciary Committee investigating the Watergate scandal issued a subpoena for the report and evidence, and immediately found themselves in court. H.R. Haldeman, President Nixon’s former chief of staff, moved to block production citing Rule 6(e), the same provision cited by Barr.District Court Judge John J. Sirica rejected Haldeman’s claim and ruled that Rule 6(e) was no bar to disclosure to the committee. Haldeman appealed, and the case was heard by the full slate of D.C. Circuit active judges in a rarely convened en banc proceeding. Ruling 5-1, the D.C. Circuit affirmed the district judge’s analysis on March 21, 1974, in Haldeman v. Sirica . The only dissenter was a Nixon appointee, George MacKinnon.The documents were promptly produced to the House Judiciary Committee. While the Jaworski report and underlying evidence did not themselves become public – Rule 6(e) was honored — the report became known as “the Road Map” and guided the committee’s ongoing investigation. Four months later the committee reported articles of impeachment. Two weeks later, President Nixon resigned.Rule 6(e) is an important bulwark protecting the security of the grand jury investigative process and it is unreasonable to expect the attorney general to violate it. But the D.C. Circuit’s 1974 en banc decision is clear precedent for the proposition that House Judiciary proceedings fall within the category of appropriate exceptions to Rule 6(e). Per Haldeman, all Chairman Nadler needs is a subpoena. He should not wait. He should get his hands on the report and all the underlying evidence — as his predecessor Rodino did — and start his investigative work. And he needs to do so now, in anticipation of a court battle.At the same time, House Intelligence Chair Adam Schiff and Senate Intelligence Vice-Chair Mark Warner should demand the unredacted report for their own committees. By statute they are entitled to it, and Rule 6(e) is no bar to sharing information provided to intelligence officials. Another regulation, 50 USC § 3092, provides that the intelligence committees must be given reports, in writing if desired, of significant intelligence and counterintelligence activities or failures. Mueller’s findings certainly qualify. Where matters are too delicate to share with all the members of the intelligence committees, statute and established practice provide that disclosure may be made to a smaller circle known as the “Gang of Eight”: the chair and ranking member of each intelligence committee, and the Democratic and Republican leaders of each chamber.\\n\\n                                                2020 \\n\\n                                            By Joanna Weiss\\n\\n                                                Wealth Of Nations\\n\\n                                            By Michael Grunwald\\n\\n                                                History Dept.\\n\\n                                            By Susan PageAnd by explicit language, Rule 6(e) specifically exempts intelligence shared with government officials from the restrictions on grand jury disclosure, thanks to language added after the 9/11 attacks. Before then, investigators were unwisely barred from sharing evidence gathered by grand jury with their intelligence counterparts. The 2002 amendments made it clear that Rule 6(e) would no longer be a bar. See Rule 6(e)(3)(D).So just as a startingly on-point D.C. Circuit en banc precedent indicates the full report and underlying evidence may be shared with the Judiciary Committee, clear statutory language gives the same right to the intelligence committees.Of course, any disclosure to the committees is subject to the laws governing grand jury and classified information. Chairman Rodino did not publicly release the Jaworski report and evidence (although a D.C. court finally ordered its public release last year). But like Jaworski’s report 45 years ago, Mueller’s could serve as a crucial road map for the judiciary and intelligence committees as they weigh the harm done by Russia’s meddling in our 2016 elections – building their own cases, calling witnesses and collecting the documents as Chairman Nadler has already begun to do.Congressional Democrats should accept this imperfect result. There are good reasons why grand jury proceedings and intelligence activities are generally shielded from full public view — to promote candor, stealth and speed, and to protect both the innocent and the guilty until the time to strike. Let Barr redact the Mueller report for public review — a bowdlerized document that will doubtless leave more questions than answers, but at least will be public.But the judiciary and intelligence committees are entitled to everything Mueller has produced, unredacted. Chairs Nadler and Schiff should immediately assert their rights and subpoena the full Mueller report and underlying evidence. And then their important work can begin.Law And Order\\n\\n                        By Nelson W.

But corporations, not politicians or activists, are leading the post-meat revolution.\\n                    By MICHAEL GRUNWALDApril 01, 2019\\n                        \\n                            | Joe Raedle/Getty ImagesMichael Grunwald is a senior staff writer for\\xa0Politico Magazine.Politicians often rally their supporters with partisan red meat, but these days Republicans are using actual red meat. They’re accusing Democrats of a plot to ban beef, trying to rebrand the Green New Deal for climate action as a nanny-state assault on the American diet. At Thursday’s rally in Michigan, President Donald Trump portrayed a green dystopia with “no more cows.” In a recent Washington speech, former Trump aide Sebastian Gorka warned conservatives that leftists are coming for their hamburgers: “This is what Stalin dreamt about, but never achieved!” Rep. Rob Bishop (R-Utah) actually ate a burger during a press conference on Capitol Hill, an activity he claimed would be illegal under a Green New Deal. In reality, nobody’s banning beef. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), the driving force behind the Green New Deal, really did suggest that “maybe we shouldn’t be eating a hamburger for breakfast, lunch and dinner,” and her office did release (and then retract) a fact sheet implying a desire to “get rid of farting cows.” A lot of environmental activists really do target red meat, and Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) , a vegan who hopes to replace Trump, really did recently observe that “this planet simply can’t sustain billions of people consuming industrially produced animal agriculture.” But the actual Green New Deal resolution calls only for dramatic reductions of greenhouse-gas emissions from agriculture. It says nothing about seizing steaks, and no Democrats are pushing to confiscate cows regardless of their tailpipe emissions.Story Continued Below This Washington stir over the burger police is classic political theater, the latest tribal skirmish in America’s partisan culture wars. But livestock really do have a serious impact on the climate—and the extreme rhetoric about cow farts and rounding up ranchers is obscuring a consequential debate over the future of animal agriculture in general and beef in particular. Red meat has a greater impact on the climate than any other food; if the world’s cattle formed their own nation, it would have the third-highest emissions on Earth, behind only China and the United States. So at a time when concerns are already growing about meat’s effects on human health and the treatment of animals on factory farms, the U.S. meat industry is taking the global warming debate seriously. It’s talking up its own climate progress, while trying to ensure that any Green New Deal-style government efforts to cut agricultural emissions use financial carrots rather than regulatory sticks or even meat taxes.Meat is as central to American culture as cars or sports; the average American eats three burgers a week, and even more chicken than beef. But this is a delicate time for the industry. The influential EAT-Lancet Commission study recently warned that Western diets include far too much meat, and more than half of Americans say they’re trying to cut back. New York City’s schools just adopted Meatless Mondays, while fast-growing companies like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods are selling plant-based burgers and other products that taste, look and even feel remarkably similar to conventional meat; starting Monday, Burger King is going to start selling beef-free Impossible Whoppers. The meat lobby is also increasingly nervous about “fake meat,” its term of art for cell-based meat startups that are not even selling to the public yet, but are already producing meat in laboratories that’s molecularly identical to the stuff in supermarkets without raising or killing animals.Meat producers don’t want their products to be viewed like fossil fuels—useful but dirty. And beef producers don’t want to follow the path of coal, which is hemorrhaging market share because it’s the dirtiest fossil fuel. Colin Woodall, head of government affairs for the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, says his industry can help save the planet as well as help feed the planet.“We know the spotlight is on us right now,” Woodall says. “The way we see it, the Green New Deal has given us a great opportunity to tell our story.” So far, any serious political discussion over the future of meat has been drowned out by the cow-farting furor, as Republicans like Ted Cruz, Scott Walker, and even Trump critic Meghan McCain have mocked vegan fascists who would, in the words of Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, force Americans to “say goodbye to dairy, to beef, to family farms, to ranches.” It’s a wildly exaggerated attack—and nobody actually believes we should eat burgers for breakfast, lunch and dinner—but it packs a punch in a meat-loving country. Data for Progress co-founder Sean McElwee, whose liberal group has helped shape the Green New Deal, says he’d love to rein in the immense economic and cultural power of America’s “meatriarchy.” But his polling has found there’s literally nothing less popular than banning meat. “It’s up there with giving VA benefits to ISIS,” McElwee says. “That’s the tension the left has to struggle with; Democrats eat meat, too. But even minor improvements could create massive gains for public health and the environment.” The U.S. produces about 50 billion pounds of meat a year, and globally, pastures occupy about one-fourth of the ice-free land on Earth. So changes in how meat is produced and consumed really could have outsized impacts. In fact, some changes are happening. And some of the industry’s advocates and critics agree that the best way to spread them just might be…a Green New Deal.*** The world loves meat, but that love puts pressure on the world. The United Nations has estimated that livestock are responsible for 14.5 percent of the greenhouse-gas emissions that are trapping heat in the atmosphere. Project Drawdown, a group of scientists pursuing climate solutions, puts the figure at 18 to 20 percent, and some studies have suggested even that’s way too low. In any case, meat is a significant contributor to the climate crisis, and as millions of families in India and China join the meat-eating middle class, its contributions could soar. A recent World Resources Institute report titled “Creating a Sustainable Food Future” found that demand for animal-based foods is on track to rise more than two thirds by 2050; it also warned that the resulting expansion of agricultural production could produce enough emissions to exceed the Paris climate agreement’s targets for catastrophic warming even if the world completely stops using fossil fuels. “We just can’t feed an expanding world population on meat, not if we keep growing it the way we’re growing it,” says Jessica Almy, policy director for the Good Food Institute, which promotes plant-based and cell-based meat alternatives. Beef production is the worst climate offender in the agricultural sector. That WRI report on food sustainability calculated that beef creates about seven times as many greenhouse gas emissions per unit of protein as chicken or pork, and 20 times as many as peas or lentils. One reason is that grass-eating ruminants like cows release huge amounts of methane, a greenhouse gas 30 times as potent as carbon dioxide. They do this primarily by burping, not farting, despite National Review’s cover cartoon of Ocasio-Cortez surrounded by the rear ends of cows, but methane helps warm the earth no matter which end it comes from. Still, some agricultural experts believe cattle methane has been overstated as a climate disaster. Marty Matlock, an ecological engineering professor who runs the University of Arkansas Resiliency Center, says the methane produced by U.S. cows is not much greater than the methane produced by the wild buffalo that once roamed the U.S. plains. He says that unlike carbon from fossil fuels, which gets released into the atmosphere after lying underground for millions of years, methane from ruminants is part of a natural cycle that expands only when herds expand. And in the U.S., herds are shrinking. America now produces the same amount of beef it did in 1970 with one-third fewer cattle, and 81 percent more milk than it did in 1945 with two-thirds fewer dairy cows.“Methane from livestock isn’t what’s new. Burning fossil fuels for energy and transportation is what’s new,” Matlock says. “Climate change is an existential threat to human well-being, but let’s keep the focus where it belongs.” The more significant problem with meat production is that it uses enormous amounts of land, both for grazing and growing grain for cattle feed. Pastures and farms that are used to fatten cattle often replace forests, wetlands and grasslands that store enormous amounts of carbon. Even America’s relatively efficient beef production takes up more than 40 percent of U.S. agricultural land to produce just 3 percent of U.S. calories. The World Resources Institute report warned that unless consumers eat less meat and producers get more efficient, by 2050 the world will have to deforest a land mass nearly twice the size of India (and releasing much of its sequestered carbon) to satisfy the additional demand. “Growing red meat just takes up too much land to generate too few calories and too little protein,” says Tim Searchinger, the lead author of the report. Again, though, the U.S. meat industry does more with less than its less efficient foreign counterparts. It produces 18 percent of the world’s beef with only 8 percent of the world’s cattle, thanks to cutting-edge genetics, advanced veterinary care, and data-driven industrial processes optimized to fatten cattle quickly and cost-effectively. Kevin Kester, a fifth-generation rancher in Parkfield, California, says it takes him six weeks less than it took his grandfather to raise a half-ton steer, and he expects his grandchildren to achieve similar productivity gains. Kester also reduces his emissions by running his wells on solar power, and by using drones to check his water lines for leaks rather than driving his truck around his 22,000-acre ranch.\\n                            President Donald Trump speaks behind a table covered with fast food as he welcomes the North Dakota State Bison football team to the White House on March 4, 2019. | Oliver Contreras-Pool/Getty Images Overall, U.S. animal agriculture only produces about 4 percent of direct U.S. emissions, much less than its competition abroad. That’s partly because the U.S. emits so much carbon from gasoline and fossil-fueled electricity, but it’s partly a triumph of efficiency; the average dairy cow in California produces four times as much milk as a cow in Mexico and 23 times as much as a cow in India. Kester argues that if Green New Deal advocates succeed in reducing U.S. cattle production, it will just move to countries that require more land to produce less meat, endangering carbon sinks like the Amazon and dramatically expanding global emissions. “There’s so much ignorance about what we do,” Kester says. “Most Americans used to have a farmer or rancher in the family, but now hardly anyone knows where their steak comes from. And we’re way behind the curve on educating the public.” The industry’s climate message is that it can be part of the solution—not only by increasing yields through more intensive production, but by storing more carbon in its pastures and cutting emissions from its operations. For example, one of Project Drawdown’s top 10 proposals for fixing the climate was “silvopasture,” planting more carbon-storing trees on grazing lands. Bill Gates recently touted the potential of “regenerative agriculture,” which uses cover crops and no-till farming to keep more carbon in the soil, to grow animal feed with fewer emissions. And some ranchers use climate-friendly “rotational grazing” to mimic the patterns of migratory buffalo herds; cattle are clustered in one area to devour the grass and fertilize the soil with their manure, then moved to another area so the grass can regrow. General Mills is encouraging its suppliers to embrace these practices; Jerry Lynch, the company’s chief sustainability officer, says one Georgia rancher who provides beef for its EPIC Meat Snacks is sequestering so much carbon his overall emissions are approaching zero. “We’ve got to be concerned about the challenges the planet is facing,” Lynch says. “We’ve been in business for 150 years, and we hope to be for 150 more.” Conglomerates like Wal-Mart, McDonald’s and General Mills have been setting emissions reduction targets for their suppliers, which will ratchet up pressure on farmers and ranchers to green their operations. But at a time when they’re already getting squeezed by a handful of giant agribusinesses that process their animals, as well as the economic fallout from President Donald Trump’s trade wars, they’re hoping for government incentives to reduce their emissions. Frank Mitloehner, a professor of animal agriculture at the University of California-Davis, believes farmers and ranchers deserve to be paid for their ecological services—and recently said so to an Ocasio-Cortez staffer. For example, California is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to help them manage their manure in cleaner ways, which makes more sense to Mitloehner than demonizing them for the messes they make while putting food on people’s tables. Many of them are conservative Republicans who deny climate science, but they’re also pragmatic businesspeople—Mitloehner says they could store tremendous amounts of carbon on their lands if the price and the politics were right. “Politically, farmers tend toward the Trump camp, and when they hear all this finger-pointing about farting cows, they just shut down,” Mitloehner says. “It troubles me, because I know how urgent this climate discussion is.”Last year’s farm bill did include some modest new conservation incentives for ranchers who pursue more climate-friendly grazing practices. But they haven’t been widely adopted yet, and the impressive yield improvements that have bolstered the U.S. meat industry’s sustainability arguments seem to be tapering off. One reason it’s become increasingly difficult to do more with less is climate change. Kester, the California rancher, has seen his yields reduced by droughts in eight of the last 10 years, and a nasty weed called Medusahead rye has invaded his parched pastures, reducing their carrying capacity by about 20 percent.If meat producers can set aside their skepticism about the Green New Deal, and Green New Deal supporters can set aside their skepticism about meat, there’s potential for a compromise that would provide more lucrative opportunities for meat producers to go green. Jacy Reece is the research director at an anti-meat thinktank called the Sentience Institute, and the author of a new book called The End of Animal Farming, but he says that for now he’s excited about reforms that could make animal farming more sustainable. “If we’ve only got 12 years to act to avoid a global catastrophe, we’ve got to get started now,” he says. “The industry won’t look like I might want it to look, but it can be a lot more sustainable.”*** Eating animals actually helped humans become human. Meat added so much nutrition to the diets of our pre-human ancestors that they no longer had to spend all their time foraging; they started to develop larger brains and smaller stomachs. “It transformed our species in a positive way, physiologically and socially,” says Matlock, the University of Arkansas professor who argues against excessive focus on cattle methane. Matlock is one of the American meat industry’s favorite scientists, because his studies have documented its improvements in sustainability. In our conversation, he emphasized that meat has helped feed humanity for 2.5 million years, helping to free billions of people from “the tyranny of hunger.” Yet Matlock also told me: Americans eat too much meat. “No doubt about it,” he said. For the sake of their health and the sake of the planet, he said, meat-eaters and particularly beef-eaters in rich countries shouldn’t just eat more sustainable meat; they should eat less meat. “Meat should become more expensive,” he said. “We shouldn’t ration it and turn it into the next cocaine, but we do need options.”Impossible Foods is now selling plant-based options at more than 5,000 restaurants around the U.S.; its new partnership with Burger King will only start with 59 outlets in the St. Louis area, but it could catapult the company into the mainstream. The Impossible message to the public, conveyed in this new video of expletive-filled double-takes from actual diners informed that the Whoppers they just ate were made of plants, is that you can help save the planet and prevent the use and abuse of animals without sacrificing the joy of meat.Beyond Meat’s strategy relies more on the meat aisle of supermarkets like Whole Foods and Kroger’s; it’s now in 38,000 locations in 20 countries, touting itself as “a better way to feed the planet.” A University of Michigan study found that the company’s burgers—made with peas, potato starch, beets and other vegetarian ingredients that mimic the chewiness, juiciness and tastiness of ground beef—produce 90 percent fewer greenhouse gases per pound than conventional meat. CEO Ethan Brown says that if the average American replaced one animal-based burger with a Beyond Burger every week, the emissions impact would be equivalent to taking 12 million cars off the road. Brown is a vegan, and he believes our big brains that developed with the help of meat are now telling us there must be a way to enjoy meat without increasing our risk of heart disease, treating sentient animals like disposable raw materials, and imperiling the planet. “There’s a perfect storm around meat right now,” he says. But Brown says he’s not trying to break up humanity’s 2.5 million-year-old relationship with meat. He’s trying to replicate the architecture of meat—mostly amino acids, lipids and water—with plants rather than animals that eat plants, reducing the health risks and ethical dilemmas as well as the climate impacts. He’s marketing to meat eaters, not meat haters, and has found that the vast majority of consumers buying his products put animal-based foods in their shopping carts as well. His investors include the poultry giant Tyson Foods, and he hired the original architect of the dairy industry’s “Got Milk?” campaign to craft his “Go Beyond” pitch. Beyond Meat has tripled its sales three years in a row, and has now sold more than 50 million burgers. McDonald’s has sold more than 300 billion burgers. But Brown believes the meat industry is ripe for disruption, just as the dairy industry has been losing market share to almond milk and other plant-based alternatives. “We’ve only been at this for 10 years. The human race has been eating meat throughout time,” Brown says. “It’s still sacrilege to say we can do it without animals; it’s fighting words. But we don’t always have to do things the same way.”The most daunting long-term threat to the industrial meat system may be “clean meat” grown from stem cells in a sterile lab, avoiding the climate impacts, moral quandaries, and real-world inefficiencies of raising animals for slaughter. The startup Memphis Meats can convert cells biopsied from a cow into a finished meatball in just a few weeks, feeding them solutions of amino acids, sugars and other nutrients the cow would have needed to grow. It doesn’t have to waste resources growing hooves, teeth or other inedible animal parts. It doesn’t have to worry about cattle getting sick or slaughterhouses getting contaminated. And it doesn’t require giant expanses of land that could otherwise grow more calories or store more carbon. The company hopes to have products virtually identical to conventional meat in stores by 2021, although its T-bones won’t have bones; in the future, customized meat could even be healthier than the real thing, with more Omega-3s or less saturated fat. “The world is going to need to produce a lot more food with a lot less land and a lot less waste,” says Eric Schulze, the vice president of product and regulation for Memphis Meats, which has attracted investment from Cargill as well as Tyson. “We’re not trying to supplant an existing industry overnight. But if we do our job correctly, there will be a gigantic sustainability benefit.”The conventional meat lobby is happy to talk about ways its products can be more sustainable, but it is quite vigorously opposed to the idea of people eating less of its products. And it does see phrases like “plant-based meat” and “clean meat” as fighting words. It helped pressure Missouri to pass a law prohibiting the labeling of any product as meat unless it’s “derived from harvested production livestock or poultry,” and 21 other states are now considering similar labeling restrictions on meat and dairy substitutes. The agriculture lobby is a powerful political force, and ranchers, like community bankers or auto dealers, tend to have outsized influence because they’re relevant in just about every part of the country; 31 states have more than a million head of cattle. But with climate activists pushing for new rules to clean up meat production and public health activists pushing to revise dietary recommendations to reduce meat intake, the industry is playing a lot more defense. “It used to be just activist groups saying you need to eat less meat to save the planet. We’re alarmed that it’s creeping into the mainstream,” says Hannah Thompson-Weeman, a vice president with the Animal Agriculture Alliance. Republicans would love the Green New Deal debate to be a referendum on meat, pitting red-blooded carnivores against organic-kale hippies. President Trump, an avid consumer of fast-food burgers and overcooked steak, is already vowing to run for reelection against the Green New Deal and its alleged plan to “permanently eliminate” cattle. And Democrats do seem defensive about the issue, because meat is more popular than any politician; despite all the health warnings and PETA protests, it’s still often true that beef, as the slogan goes, is what’s for dinner. Jane Kleeb, the Nebraska Democratic Party chair, recently tweeted that the left’s growing obsession with meat’s climate impacts helps illustrate why Democrats keep losing the rural vote: “Can we focus our attention on fossil fuels rather than farmers and ranchers?”\\n\\n                                                Law And Order\\n\\n                                            By Renato Mariotti\\n\\n                                                History Dept.\\n\\n                                            By Frederic J.

That may be a populist play for the rural vote in the Iowa caucus, although Booker is a longtime meat-industry critic and Warren has pushed for tougher antitrust enforcement throughout the economy. But whatever the motives, McElwee of Data for Progress thinks attacking the corporate structure of the “meatriarchy” is a much better long-term strategy for liberals who hope to limit meat consumption than attacking the individual choices of meat eaters. “It sucks that humans don’t care about cows, but people think they’re being personally attacked if you criticize meat,” he says. “You gotta criticize the system.” Ultimately, McElwee would love to launch “a mass propaganda campaign on a scale that’s never been done before” to persuade people to eat less meat. But it’s not happening now, and it’s not the kind of message he would advise any Democrat in a swing district to embrace. Meat is too potent a symbol in the culture wars, the political equivalent of an assault weapon that 95 percent of the population happens to enjoy, and Republicans would love to campaign as the defenders of the right to grill. There’s not going to be a Green New Deal or any ambitious climate action as long as Trump is president, anyway. But the status quo with meat is not sustainable in a climate-constrained world, even if meat advocates don’t often admit it and Green New Deal advocates don’t often admit they want to change it. There’s an obvious path to compromise; one former agribusiness CEO told me he often reminds farmers and ranchers who resent being pestered by the sustainability police that they are vastly outnumbered, and that if they don’t figure out ways to do better their critics will end up dictating ways for them to do better. Some industry leaders are coming around to the view that their best hope of averting burdensome regulations and taxes on meat in the future would be to ramp up their sustainability now. And the Green New Deal, which is still just a vague set of green policy ambitions, could be an opportunity for Washington to help finance the ramp-up as the details get hashed out. Whatever else you can say about farmers and ranchers, they own a lot of land that can store a lot of carbon. “There’s such an enormous opportunity to reduce emissions in meat production, if you didn’t hear all this counterproductive talk about how everything about it is terrible,” says Mitloehner, the Cal-Davis agricultural scientist. “Let’s not alienate the people we need the most on our quest for a climate solution.”Law And Order\\n\\n                        By Nelson W.
