Majority of primary candidates have announced their candidature and are jostling for making early in-roads for broader name recognition and gaining momentum initialy to last deep into debate time and eventually to become the candidate. This notebook will rely on articles published on Politico.com and run sentiment analysis against the names of these candidates. \n",

    "- P1: As part of data cleanup, all sentences that did not have direct references to candidates' last names were removed. This included sentences where candidates were referred to by their respctive gender based pronouns. Need to find ways to capture that level of contextual information. Check whether BERT can account for something like this.\n",
