    "This notebook demonstrates use of web search as an agentic tool. We are retrieving the most recent published values of a few major central bank rates (SOFR, SONIA). Specific target sites have been provided to the tool to ensure veracity and authenticity of the information retrieved. The tool is expected to contain its search and response within these target sites. The thought behind this type of tool is to demonstrate that agents can be used to systematically traverse through a range of sites retrieving specific information from each of them and aggregate the final collection in the user requested format. In this case, this can be something like:\n",
