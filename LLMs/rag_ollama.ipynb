    "This notebooks has a sample workflow of Retrival Augmented Generation (RAG). Components covered in this scaled-down implementation include:\n",
    "- Meta's llama 3.2 as LLM.\n",
    "- Ollama as LLM deployment framework.\n",
    "- Model 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2' for generating embeddings.\n",
    "- The documents ingested are publicly available Loan IQ sample documents. Loan IQ is used in Commercial Syndicated Lending business.\n",
    "- Chroma DB has been used as the Vector DB. The production implementation can use Zilliz, pgVector, MongoDB, Pinecone etcetera based on latency and cost considerations.\n",
