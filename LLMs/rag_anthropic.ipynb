    "## RAG with Anthropic Claude-3-5-sonnet\n",
    "Author: **Peeyush Sharma**; Feedback: **PSharma3@gmail.com**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebooks has a sample workflow of Retrival Augmented Generation (RAG). A series of questions have been asked against 15 total PDF files totaling 10MB in size. See the bottom of this page for model responses and a cross check against the original source documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Components covered in this scaled-down implementation include:\n",
    "- Anthropic 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022' as LLM.\n",
    "- Model 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2' for generating embeddings.\n",
    "- The documents ingested are coming from  Loan Syndications and Trading Association (LSTA) https://www.lsta.org/. The persona provided to the agent is that of an analyst working at LSTA.\n",
    "- Chroma DB has been used as the Vector DB. The production implementation can use Zilliz, pgVector, MongoDB, Pinecone etcetera based on latency and cost considerations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another sample RAG with a locally deployed and therefore much smaller LLM can be cross checked here: https://github.com/psharma1544/JupyterNotebooks/blob/master/LLMs/rag_ollama.ipynb. The major difference is in the quality of responses between a fairly small local LLM and a large model demonstrated in this notebook.\n"

      "\n",
      "LLM Response: According to the \"Green Loan Principles\" document, under the section \"Green Loan Principles – Core Components\", there are four core components:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Use of Proceeds\n",
      "2. Process for Project Evaluation and Selection\n",
      "3. Management of Proceeds\n",

      "\n",
      "These core components form the framework that enables all market participants to clearly understand the characteristics of a green loan. The GLP requires that all four components must be aligned for a loan to be considered a green loan, as explicitly stated in the document: \"Green loans shall not be considered interchangeable with loans that are not aligned with the four core components of the GLP.\"\n",

      "LLM Response: Based on \"Guidance on Sustainability-Linked Loan Principles 26 March 2025\", Section 3.B.I.b:\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, the sustainability strategy of a parent can impact a borrower's eligibility for an SLL. This will depend on the relationship between the parent and the borrower, and the nature and extent of any sustainability strategy. Where a sustainability strategy applies on a group-wide basis, it is likely that such strategy will cover and be relevant to the borrower, although care should be taken to ensure this is the case.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, it's important to note that an SLL is designed to reflect or support the borrower's, or its wider group's, existing sustainability strategy, rather than being a central component of that strategy.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. Used exclusively for payroll, payroll tax, withholding tax and other employee wage and benefit payments, with funds not exceeding the actual amounts needed for the immediately succeeding payroll period (or greater amount if required by law)\n",

      "2. Used exclusively as trust accounts, escrow accounts and other accounts holding assets of non-affiliated third parties (and only to the extent of such amounts)\n",

      "\n",
      "A revolving loan can be recognized as a social loan in two scenarios:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. When it aligns with the four core components of the Social Loan Principles (SLP), as revolving credit facilities (RCFs) are explicitly included as eligible loan types.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. When the borrower does not have a designated eligible Social Project at the time of entering into the loan, an RCF can still be recognized as a social loan if:\n",
      "- The eligible category/categories of Social Projects for which the loan proceeds may be utilized is sufficiently identifiable\n",
      "- The loan satisfies all four core components of the SLP\n",
      "- The parties agree on a social loan framework for identifying eligible Social Projects\n",
      "\n",

      "LLM Response: Based on the provided documents, there are several key challenges in applying Sustainability Linked Loan Principles (SLLP) to fund finance facilities:\n",
      "\n",
      "From \"Guidance on Sustainability-Linked Loan Principles\" (Section 3.B):\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Setting Meaningful KPIs and Ambitious SPTs:\n",
      "- Determining that chosen metrics are meaningful (core to borrower's business) and SPTs are ambitious requires significant borrower input\n",
      "- SPTs must represent a true reach for the borrower and go beyond \"business as usual and regulatory requirements\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Historical Data Requirements:\n",
      "- Lack of historical data beyond baseline data can create challenges in setting and measuring targets\n",
      "- SLLs are best suited to those who already have sustainability/transition strategy in place or historical data tracking performance\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Geographic and Sector Variations:\n",
      "- Definitions of \"sustainable\" and \"sustainability\" vary depending on sector and geography\n",
      "- What may be considered an ambitious target in one region could be deemed modest in another\n",
      "- Environmental SPTs regarded as modest in developed economies could be highly ambitious in regions where decarbonization efforts are less advanced\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Timing of KPI/SPT Setting:\n",
      "- KPIs and SPTs should ideally be set before or concurrently with loan origination\n",
      "- When this isn't possible, there needs to be:\n",
      "  - Clear rationale for delay\n",
      "  - Disclosure of existing sustainability strategy\n",
      "  - Agreement on backstop date (no more than 12 months post origination)\n",
      "  - Proper scrutiny and lender consent requirements for later-set KPIs/SPTs\n",
      "\n",
      "These challenges are particularly relevant to fund finance facilities where the borrower's business model and sustainability impacts may be more complex to measure and track.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "Question: What is Principal Adverse Impact (PAI)?\n",
      "\n",
      "LLM Response: According to the \"Sustainable Lending Glossary-Dec-2023.pdf\", a Principal Adverse Impact (PAI) is any impact of investment decisions or advice that results in a negative effect on sustainability factors, such as environmental, social and employee concerns, respect for human rights, anti-corruption, and anti-bribery matters. PAI disclosures are a key reporting requirement under the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation.\n",

      "LLM Response: Based on \"External Review Guidance for Green, Social, and Sustainability-Linked Loans\" (January 2024), Section 1 \"Second Party Opinion\":\n",
      "\n",
      "A Second Party Opinion (SPO) entails an assessment of the alignment of the borrower's green, social or sustainability-linked loan or overall sustainable finance framework with the relevant Principles. For these purposes, \"alignment\" should refer to all core components of the relevant Principles. An SPO can include an assessment of the borrower's overarching objectives, strategy, policy, and/or processes relating to environmental and/or social sustainability.\n",
      "\n",
      "For green and social loans, the external reviewers should also assess:\n",
      "1. The environmental/social features of projects intended for use of proceeds\n",
      "2. The environmental/social benefits and impact targeted by eligible projects\n",
      "3. Any potentially material environmental/social risks associated with the projects\n",
      "\n",
      "For sustainability-linked loans, the external reviewer should assess:\n",
      "1. The relevance, materiality, robustness and reliability of selected KPIs\n",
      "2. The rationale and level of ambition of proposed SPTs\n",
      "3. The relevance and reliability of selected benchmarks and baselines\n",
