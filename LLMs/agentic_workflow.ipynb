    "## Agentic Workflow with RAG\n",
    "Author: **Peeyush Sharma**; Feedback: **PSharma3@gmail.com**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebooks combines Agentic AI workflow with RAG. To skip directly to the final results, compare the extractions at the bottom of this notebook with major financial returns captured in the following 10-Q submission: https://www.wellsfargo.com/assets/pdf/about/investor-relations/sec-filings/2025/first-quarter-10q.pdf\n",
    "\n",
    "Agentic AI is usually interpreted in two different ways:\n",
    "1. An autonomous set of agents that proactively monitor a condition and take action without explicit human intervention.\n",
    "2. A workflow of parallel, sequential, or iterative steps where each step is governed by a prompt and an LLM agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrate the 2nd use-case above in conjunction with RAG. To achieve that, a very detailed sequence of prompts has been used to sequentially retrieve, cleanse, and format data attributes. This specific sample covers quarterly filing of a public firm but can be extended for any data extraction use-case. The first prompt is run against \"similarity\" embeddings for commonly reported financial terms. All subsequent prompts are then called on the output of the previous prompt iteration resulting in a nicely formatted table-like structure that can easily be imported into Excel as delimited CSV."
