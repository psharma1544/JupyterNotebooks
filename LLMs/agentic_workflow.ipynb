    "## Agentic Workflow with RAG\n",
    "Author: **Peeyush Sharma**; Feedback: **PSharma3@gmail.com**\n",
    "\n",
    "Agentic AI is usually interpreted in two different ways:\n",
    "1. An autonomous set of agents that proactively monitor a condition and take action without explicit human intervention.\n",
    "2. A workflow of parallel, sequential, or iterative steps where each step is governed by a prompt and an LLM agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrate the 2nd use-case above in conjunction with RAG. A very detailed sequence of prompts has been used to sequentially retrieve, cleanse, and format data attributes. The demonstration is done with quarterly filing of a public firm but can be extended for any data extraction use-case. The first prompt is run against \"similarity\" embeddings for commonly reported financial terms. All subsequent prompts run on the output of the previous prompt iteration resulting in a nicely formatted table-like structure that can easily be imported into Excel as delimited CSV."
