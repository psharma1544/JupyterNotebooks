    "# Long / Short Signals based on Technical Indicators\n",
    "Author: **Peeyush Sharma**; Feedback: **PSharma3@gmail.com**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook captures some basic long / short signals based on technical indicators. The core daily market data was retrieved from local catalog and was subsequently used to generate various technical indicators in CSV form for a group of equities. This analysis retrieves that data and generates a list of dates with opportunities for long / short decisions. Decisions are based on relative value of closing price of an equity over any given duration (say 90 days). We start with a  broad selection of dates and gradually add limiting factors to come with optimal days to purchase equities in a bear market scenario. Similar methods can be used for normal and bull market as well with some adjustments.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is still a very high-level decision making. A stock may be on a long bull run and the 90 day averages may still not capture full potential in the long run. That kind of analysis is more detailed and is not captured in this publicly shared notebook. "

This analysis is strictly limited to the range within price movements occurs and needs to be complimented with financial analysis of returns and potential of future earnings for a full picture. \n",
