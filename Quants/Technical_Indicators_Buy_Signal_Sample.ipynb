    "# Sample Purchase Signals based on Technical Indicators\n",
    "Author: **Peeyush Sharma**; Feedback: **PSharma3@gmail.com**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook takes the work captured under 'Reference_Plot_Technical_Indicators' notebook forward and lists the stocks that meet the buying criteria listed there. The buying criteria is strictly based on technical indicators. A few of these indicators are aggregated in a single selection criteria and then samples are retrieved for certain durations (bi-weekly, monthly, quarterly etc...). There is no macro analysis here whether at economy, sector, or even longer term growth perspective level for individual company. There is no guarantee that the daily market data or the derived economic indicators are correct. This notebook is for educational and demonstrative purposes only."
